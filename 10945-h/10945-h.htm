  <h2>EDINBURGH AFTER FLODDEN</h2>

  <p>The great battle of Flodden was fought upon the 9th of
  September, 1513. The defeat of the Scottish army, mainly owing to
  the fantastic ideas of chivalry entertained by James IV., and his
  refusal to avail himself of the natural advantages of his
  position, was by far the most disastrous of any recounted in the
  history of the northern wars. The whole strength of the kingdom,
  both Lowland and Highland, was assembled, and the contest was one
  of the sternest and most desperate upon record.</p>

  <p>For several hours the issue seemed doubtful. On the left the
  Scots obtained a decided advantage; on the right wing they were
  broken and overthrown; and at last the whole weight of the battle
  was brought into the centre, where King James and the Earl of
  Surrey commanded in person. The determined valour of James,
  imprudent as it was, had the effect of rousing to a pitch of
  desperation the courage of the meanest soldiers; and the ground
  becoming soft and slippery from blood, they pulled off their
  boots and shoes, and secured a firmer footing by fighting in
  their hose.</p>

  <p>"It is owned," says Abercromby, "that both parties did
  wonders, but none on either side performed more than the King
  himself. He was again told that by coming to handy blows he could
  do no more than another man, whereas, by keeping the post due to
  his station, he might be worth many thousands. Yet he would not
  only fight in person, but also on foot; for he no sooner saw that
  body of the English give way which was defeated by the Earl of
  Huntley, but he alighted from his horse, and commanded his guard
  of noblemen and gentlemen to do the like and follow him. He had
  at first abundance of success; but at length the Lord Thomas
  Howard and Sir Edward Stanley, who had defeated their opposites,
  coming in with the Lord Dacre's horse, and surrounding the King's
  battalion on all sides, the Scots were so distressed that, for
  their last defence, they cast themselves into a ring; and being
  resolved to die nobly with their sovereign, who scorned to ask
  quarter, were altogether cut off. So say the English writers, and
  I am apt to believe that they are in the right."</p>

  <p>The battle was maintained with desperate fury until nightfall.
  At the close, according to Mr. Tytler, "Surrey was uncertain of
  the result of the battle: the remains of the enemy's centre still
  held the field; Home, with his Borderers, still hovered on the
  left; and the commander wisely allowed neither pursuit nor
  plunder, but drew off his men, and kept a strict watch during the
  night. When the morning broke, the Scottish artillery were seen
  standing deserted on the side of the hill; their defenders had
  disappeared; and the Earl ordered thanks to be given for a
  victory which was no longer doubtful. Yet, even after all this, a
  body of the Scots appeared unbroken upon a hill, and were about
  to charge the Lord-Admiral, when they were compelled to leave
  their position by a discharge of the English ordnance.</p>

  <p>"The loss of the Scots in this fatal battle amounted to about
  ten thousand men. Of these, a great proportion were of high rank;
  the remainder being composed of the gentry, the farmers, and
  landed yeomanry, who disdained to fly when their sovereign and
  his nobles lay stretched in heaps around them." Besides King
  James, there fell at Flodden the Archbishop of St. Andrew's,
  thirteen earls, two bishops, two abbots, fifteen lords and chiefs
  of clans, and five peers' eldest sons, besides La Motte the
  French ambassador, and the secretary of the King. The same
  historian adds&mdash;"The names of the gentry who fell are too
  numerous for recapitulation, since there were few families of
  note in Scotland which did not lose one relative or another,
  whilst some houses had to weep the death of all. It is from this
  cause that the sensations of sorrow and national lamentation
  occasioned by the defeat were peculiarly poignant and
  lasting&mdash;so that to this day few Scotsmen can hear the name
  of Flodden without a shudder of gloomy regret."</p>

  <p>The loss to Edinburgh on this occasion was peculiarly great.
  All the magistrates and able-bodied citizens had followed their
  King to Flodden, whence very few of them returned. The office of
  Provost or chief magistrate of the capital was at that time an
  object of ambition, and was conferred only upon persons of high
  rank and station. There seems to be some uncertainty whether the
  holder of this dignity at the time of the battle of Flodden was
  Sir Alexander Lauder, ancestor of the Fountainhall family, who
  was elected in 1511, or that great historical personage,
  Archibald Earl of Angus, better known as Archibald Bell-the-Cat,
  who was chosen in 1513, the year of the battle. Both of them were
  at Flodden. The name of Sir Alexander Lauder appears upon the
  list of the slain; Angus was one of the survivors, but his son,
  George, Master of Angus, fell fighting gallantly by the side of
  King James. The city records of Edinburgh, which commence about
  this period, are not clear upon the point, and I am rather
  inclined to think that the Earl of Angus was elected to supply
  the place of Lauder. But although the actual magistrates were
  absent, they had formally nominated deputies in their stead. I
  find, on referring to the city records, that "George of Tours"
  had been appointed to officiate in the absence of the Provost,
  and that four other persons were selected to discharge the office
  of bailies until the magistrates should return.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to describe the consternation which pervaded
  the whole of Scotland when the intelligence of the defeat became
  known. In Edinburgh it was excessive. Mr. Arnot, in the history
  of that city, says,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The news of their overthrow in the field of Flodden reached
  Edinburgh on the day after the battle, and overwhelmed the
  inhabitants with grief and confusion. The streets were crowded
  with women seeking intelligence about their friends, clamouring
  and weeping. Those who officiated in absence of the magistrates
  proved themselves worthy of the trust. They issued a
  proclamation, ordering all the inhabitants to assemble in
  military array for defence of the city, on the tolling of the
  bell; and commanding, 'that all women, and especially strangers,
  do repair to their work, and not be seen upon the street
  <i>clamorand and cryand</i>; and that women of the better sort do
  repair to the church and offer up prayers, at the stated hours,
  for our Sovereign Lord and his army, and the townsmen who are
  with the army.'"</p>

  <p>Indeed the council records bear ample evidence of the
  emergency of that occasion. Throughout the earlier pages, the
  word "Flowdoun" frequently occurs on the margin, in reference to
  various hurried orders for arming and defence; and there can be
  no doubt that, had the English forces attempted to follow up
  their victory, and attack the Scottish capital, the citizens
  would have resisted to the last. But it soon became apparent that
  the loss sustained by the English was so severe, that Surrey was
  in no condition to avail himself of the opportunity; and in fact,
  shortly afterwards, he was compelled to disband his army.</p>

  <p>The references to the city banner, contained in the following
  poem, may require a word of explanation. It is a standard still
  held in great honour and reverence by the burghers of Edinburgh,
  having been presented to them by James the Third, in return for
  their loyal service in 1482. This banner, along with that of the
  Earl Marischal, still conspicuous in the Library of the Faculty
  of Advocates, was honourably brought back from Flodden, and
  certainly never could have been displayed in a more memorable
  field. Maitland says, with reference to this very interesting
  relic of antiquity,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As a perpetual remembrance of the loyalty and bravery of the
  Edinburghers on the aforesaid occasion, the King granted them a
  banner or standard, with a power to display the same in defence
  of their king, country, and their own rights. This flag is kept
  by the Convener of the Trades; at whose appearance therewith, it
  is said that not only the artificers of Edinburgh are obliged to
  repair to it, but all the artisans or craftsmen within Scotland
  are bound to follow it, and fight under the Convener of Edinburgh
  as aforesaid."</p>

  <p>No event in Scottish history ever took a more lasting hold of
  the public mind than the "woeful fight" of Flodden; and, even
  now, the songs and traditions which are current on the Border
  recall the memory of a contest unsullied by disgrace, though
  terminating in disaster and defeat.</p>

  <h2>THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE</h2>

  <p>The most poetical chronicler would find it impossible to
  render the incidents of Montrose's brilliant career more
  picturesque than the reality. Among the devoted champions who,
  during the wildest and most stormy period of our history,
  maintained the cause of Church and King, "the Great Marquis"
  undoubtedly is entitled to the foremost place. Even party
  malevolence, by no means extinct at the present day, has been
  unable to detract from the eulogy pronounced upon him by the
  famous Cardinal de Retz, the friend of Cond&eacute; and Turenne,
  when he thus summed up his character:&mdash;"Montrose, a Scottish
  nobleman, head of the house of Grahame&mdash;the only man in the
  world that has ever realised to me the ideas of certain heroes,
  whom we now discover nowhere but in the lives of
  Plutarch&mdash;has sustained in his own country the cause of the
  King his master, with a greatness of soul that has not found its
  equal in our age."</p>

  <p>But the success of the victorious leader and patriot is almost
  thrown into the shade by the noble magnanimity and Christian
  heroism of the man in the hour of defeat and death. Without
  wishing, in any degree, to revive a controversy long maintained
  by writers of opposite political and polemical opinions, it may
  fairly be stated that Scottish history does not present us with a
  tragedy of parallel interest. That the execution of Montrose was
  the natural, nay, the inevitable, consequence of his capture, may
  be freely admitted even by the fiercest partisan of the cause for
  which he staked his life. In those times, neither party was
  disposed to lenity; and Montrose was far too conspicuous a
  character, and too dangerous a man, to be forgiven. But the
  ignominious and savage treatment which he received at the hands
  of those whose station and descent should at least have taught
  them to respect misfortune, has left an indelible stain upon the
  memory of the Covenanting chiefs, and more especially upon that
  of Argyle.</p>

  <p>The perfect serenity of the man in the hour of trial and
  death, the courage and magnanimity which he displayed to the
  last, have been dwelt upon with admiration by writers of every
  class. He heard his sentence delivered without any apparent
  emotion, and afterwards told the magistrates who waited upon him
  in prison, "that he was much indebted to the Parliament for the
  great honour they had decreed him"; adding, "that he was prouder
  to have his head placed upon the top of the prison, than if they
  had decreed a golden statue to be erected to him in the
  market-place, or that his picture should be hung in the King's
  bedchamber." He said, "he thanked them for their care to preserve
  the remembrance of his loyalty, by transmitting such monuments to
  the different parts of the kingdom; and only wished that he had
  flesh enough to have sent a piece to every city in Christendom,
  as a token of his unshaken love and fidelity to his king and
  country." On the night before his execution, he inscribed the
  following lines with a diamond on the window of his
  jail:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
  "Let them bestow on every airth a limb,
  Then, open all my veins, that I may swim
  To thee, my Maker! in that crimson lake;
  Then place my parboiled head upon a stake&mdash;
  Scatter my ashes&mdash;strew them in the air:
  Lord! since thou know'st where all these atoms are,
  I'm hopeful thou'lt recover once my dust,
  And confident thou'lt raise me with the just."
</pre>

  <p>After the Restoration, the dust <i>was</i> recovered, the
  scattered remnants collected, and the bones of the hero conveyed
  to their final resting-place by a numerous assemblage of
  gentlemen of his family and name.</p>

  <p>There is no ingredient of fiction in the historical incidents
  recorded in the following ballad. The indignities that were
  heaped upon Montrose during his procession through Edinburgh, his
  appearance before the Estates, and his last passage to the
  scaffold, as well as his undaunted bearing, have all been spoken
  to by eyewitnesses of the scene. A graphic and vivid sketch of
  the whole will be found in Mr. Mark Napier's volume, <i>The Life
  and Times of Montrose</i>&mdash;a work as chivalrous in its tone
  as the <i>Chronicles</i> of Froissart, and abounding in original
  and most interesting materials; but, in order to satisfy all
  scruple, the authorities for each fact are given in the shape of
  notes. The ballad may be considered as a narrative of the
  transactions, related by an aged Highlander, who had followed
  Montrose throughout his campaigns, to his grandson, shortly
  before the battle of Killiecrankie.</p>

  <h2>NOTES TO "THE EXECUTION OF MONTROSE"</h2>
  <pre>
  "<i>A traitor sold him to his foes</i>,"&mdash;<a href=
"#p36">III.</a>
</pre>

  <p>"The contemporary historian of the Earls of Sutherland
  records, that (after the defeat of Invercarron) Montrose and
  Kinnoul 'wandered up the river Kyle the whole ensuing night, and
  the next day, and the third day also, without any food or
  sustenance, and at last came within the country of Assynt. The
  Earl of Kinnoul, being faint for lack of meat, and not able to
  travel any further, was left there among the mountains, where it
  was supposed he perished. Montrose had almost famished, but that
  he fortuned in his misery to light upon a small cottage in that
  wilderness, where he was supplied with some milk and bread.' Not
  even the iron frame of Montrose could endure a prolonged
  existence under such circumstances. He gave himself up to Macleod
  of Assynt, a former adherent, from whom he had reason to expect
  assistance in consideration of that circumstance, and, indeed,
  from the dictates of honourable feeling and common humanity. As
  the Argyle faction had sold the King, so this Highlander rendered
  his own name infamous by selling the hero to the Covenanters, for
  which 'duty to the public' he was rewarded with four hundred
  bolls of meal."&mdash;NAPIER'S <i>Life of Montrose</i>.</p>

</pre>

  <p>"<i>Friday, 17th May</i>.&mdash;Act ordaining James Grahame to
  be brought from the Watergate on a cart, bareheaded, the hangman
  in his livery, covered, riding on the horse that draws the
  cart&mdash;the prisoner to be bound to the cart with a
  rope&mdash;to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and from thence to be
  brought to the Parliament House, and there, in the place of
  delinquents, on his knees, to receive his sentence&mdash;viz., to
  be hanged on a gibbet at the Cross of Edinburgh, with his book
  and declaration tied on a rope about his neck, and there to hang
  for the space of three hours until he be dead; and thereafter to
  be cut down by the hangman, his head, hands, and legs to be cut
  off, and distributed as follows&mdash;viz., his head to be
  affixed on an iron pin, and set on the pinnacle of the west gavel
  of the new prison of Edinburgh; one hand to be set on the port of
  Perth, the other on the port of Stirling; one leg and foot on the
  port of Aberdeen, the other on the port of Glasgow. If at his
  death penitent, and relaxed from excommunication, then the trunk
  of his body to be interred, by pioneers, in the Greyfriars;
  otherwise, to be interred in the Boroughmuir, by the hangman's
  men, under the gallows."&mdash;BALFOUR'S <i>Notes of
  Parliament</i>.</p>

  <p>It is needless to remark that this inhuman sentence was
  executed to the letter. In order that the exposure might be more
  complete, the cart was constructed with a high chair in the
  centre, having holes behind, through which the ropes that
  fastened him were drawn. The author of the <i>Wigton Papers</i>,
  recently published by the Maitland Club, says, "The reason of his
  being tied to the cart was in hope that the people would have
  stoned him, and that he might not be able by his hands to save
  his face." His hat was then pulled off by the hangman and the
  procession commenced.</p>

        He looked so great and high</i>,"&mdash;<a href=

</pre>

  <p>"In all the way, there appeared in him such majesty, courage,
  modesty&mdash;and even somewhat more than natural&mdash;that
  those common women who had lost their husbands and children in
  his wars, and who were hired to stone him, were upon the sight of
  him so astonished and moved, that their intended curses turned
  into tears and prayers; so that next day <i>all the ministers
  preached against them for not stoning and reviling
  him."&mdash;Wigton Papers.</i></p>

  "<i>Then first a woman's voice was heard

</pre>

  <p>"It is remarkable that, of the many thousand beholders, the
  Lady Jean Gordon, Countess of Haddington, did (alone) publicly
  insult and laugh at him; which being perceived by a gentleman in
  the street, he cried up to her, that it became her better to sit
  upon the cart for her adulteries."&mdash;<i>Wigton Papers</i>.
  This infamous woman was the third daughter of Huntly, and the
  niece of Argyle. It will hardly be credited that she was the
  sister of that gallant Lord Gordon, who fell fighting by the side
  of Montrose, only five years before, at the battle of
  Aldford!</p>

  <p>"The Lord Lorn and his new lady were also sitting on a
  balcony, joyful spectators; and the cart being stopped when it
  came before the lodging where the Chancellor, Argyle, and
  Warristoun sat&mdash;that they might have time to
  insult&mdash;he, suspecting the business, turned his face towards
  them, whereupon they presently crept in at the windows; which
  being perceived by an Englishman, he cried up, it was no wonder
  they started aside at his look, for they durst not look him in
  the face these seven years bygone."&mdash;<i>Wigton

</pre>

  <p>Archibald Johnston of Warristoun. This man, who was the
  inveterate enemy of Montrose, and who carried the most selfish
  spirit into every intrigue of his party, received the punishment
  of his treasons about eleven years afterwards. It may be
  instructive to learn how he met his doom. The following extract
  is from the MSS. of Sir George Mackenzie:&mdash;"The Chancellor
  and others waited to examine him; he fell upon his face, roaring,
  and with tears entreated they would pity a poor creature who had
  forgot all that was in the Bible. This moved all the spectators
  with a deep melancholy; and the Chancellor, reflecting upon the
  man's great parts, former esteem, and the great share he had in
  all the late revolutions, could not deny some tears to the
  frailty of silly mankind. At his examination, he pretended he had
  lost so much blood by the unskilfulness of his chirurgeons, that
  he lost his memory with his blood; and I really believe that his
  courage had been drawn out with it. Within a few days he was
  brought before the parliament, where he discovered nothing but
  much weakness, running up and down upon his knees, begging mercy;
  but the parliament ordained his former sentence to be put to
  execution, and accordingly he was executed at the Cross of
  Edinburgh."</p>

  <p>"He said he was much beholden to the parliament for the honour
  they had put on him; 'for,' says he, 'I think it a greater honour
  to have my head standing on the port of this town, for this
  quarrel, than to have my picture in the king's bedchamber. I am
  beholden to you that, lest my loyalty should be forgotten, ye
  have appointed five of your most eminent towns to bear witness of

  incarnate silk, and his shoes with their ribbands on his feet;
  and sarks provided for him with pearling about, above ten pund
  the elne. All these were provided for him by his friends, and a
  pretty cassock put on upon him, upon the scaffold, wherein he was

  <p>The Presbyterian ministers beset Montrose both in prison and
  on the scaffold. The following extracts are from the diary of the
  Rev. Robert Traill, one of the persons who were appointed by the
  commission of the kirk "to deal with him:"&mdash;"By a warrant
  from the kirk, we staid a while with him about his soul's
  condition. But we found him continuing in his old pride, and
  taking very ill what was spoken to him, saying, 'I pray you,
  gentlemen, let me die in peace.' It was answered, that he might
  die in true peace, being reconciled to the Lord and to His
  kirk."&mdash;"We returned to the commission, and did show unto
  them what had passed amongst us. They, seeing that for the
  present he was not desiring relaxation from his censure of
  excommunication, did appoint Mr. Mungo Law and me to attend on
  the morrow on the scaffold, at the time of his execution, that,
  in case he should desire to be relaxed from his excommunication,
  we should be allowed to give it unto him in the name of the kirk,
  and to pray with him, and for him, <i>that what is loosed on
  earth might be loosed in heaven</i>." But this pious intention,
  which may appear somewhat strange to the modern Calvinist, when
  the prevailing theories of the kirk regarding the efficacy of
  absolution are considered, was not destined to be fulfilled. Mr.
  Traill goes on to say, "But he did not at all desire to be
  relaxed from his excommunication in the name of the kirk, <i>yea,
  did not look towards that place on the scaffold where we
  stood</i>; only he drew apart some of the magistrates, and spake
  a while with them, and then went up the ladder, in his red
  scarlet cassock, in a very stately manner."</p>

  "<i>And he climbed the lofty ladder
        As it were the path to heaven</i>,"&mdash;<a href=

</pre>

  <p>"He was very earnest that he might have the liberty to keep on
  his hat; it was denied: he requested he might have the privilege
  to keep his cloak about him&mdash;neither could that be granted.
  Then, with a most undaunted courage, he went up to the top of
  that prodigious gibbet."&mdash;"The whole people gave a general
  groan; and it was very observable, that even those who, at his
  first appearance, had bitterly inveighed against him, could not
  now abstain from tears."&mdash;<i>Montrose Redivivus</i>.</p>

  <h2>THE HEART OF THE BRUCE</h2>

  <p>Hector Boece, in his very delightful, though somewhat
  apocryphal Chronicles of Scotland, tells us, that "quhen Schir
  James Dowglas was chosin as maist worthy of all Scotland to pass
  with King Robertis hart to the Holy Land, he put it in ane cais
  of gold, with arromitike and precious unyementis; and tuke with
  him Schir William Sinclare and Schir Robert Logan, with mony
  othir nobilmen, to the haly graif; quhare he buryit the said
  hart, with maist reverence and solempnitie that could be
  devisit."</p>

  <p>But no contemporary historian bears out the statement of the
  old canon of Aberdeen. Froissart, Fordun, and Barbour all agree
  that the devotional pilgrimage of the Good Sir James was not
  destined to be accomplished, and that the heart of Scotland's
  greatest king and hero was brought back to the land of his
  nativity. Mr. Tytler, in few words, has so graphically recounted
  the leading events of this expedition, that I do not hesitate to
  adopt his narrative:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As soon as the season of the year permitted, Douglas, having
  the heart of his beloved master under his charge, set sail from
  Scotland, accompanied by a splendid retinue, and anchored off
  Sluys in Flanders, at this time the great seaport of the
  Netherlands. His object was to find out companions with whom he
  might travel to Jerusalem; but he declined landing, and for
  twelve days received all visitors on board his ship with a state
  almost kingly.</p>

  <p>"At Sluys he heard that Alonzo, the King of Leon and Castile,
  was carrying on war with Osmyn, the Moorish governor of Grenada.
  The religious mission which he had embraced, and the vows he had
  taken before leaving Scotland, induced Douglas to consider
  Alonzo's cause as a holy warfare; and, before proceeding to
  Jerusalem, he first determined to visit Spain, and to signalise
  his prowess against the Saracens. But his first field against the
  Infidels proved fatal to him who, in the long English war, had
  seen seventy battles. The circumstances of his death were
  striking and characteristic. In an action near Theba, on the
  borders of Andalusia, the Moorish cavalry were defeated; and,
  after their camp had been taken, Douglas, with his companions,
  engaged too eagerly in the pursuit, and, being separated from the
  main body of the Spanish army, a strong division of the Moors
  rallied and surrounded them. The Scottish knight endeavoured to
  cut his way through the Infidels, and in all probability would
  have succeeded, had he not again turned to rescue Sir William
  Saint Clair of Roslin, whom he saw in jeopardy. In attempting
  this, he was inextricably involved with the enemy. Taking from
  his neck the casket which contained the heart of Bruce, he cast
  it before him, and exclaimed with a loud voice, 'Now pass onward
  as thou wert wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die!' The
  action and the sentiment were heroic, and they were the last
  words and deed of a heroic life, for Douglas fell, overpowered by
  his enemies; and three of his knights, and many of his
  companions, were slain along with their master. On the succeeding
  day, the body and the casket were both found on the field, and by
  his surviving friends conveyed to Scotland. The heart of Bruce
  was deposited at Melrose, and the body of the 'Good Sir
  James'&mdash;the name by which he is affectionately remembered by
  his countrymen&mdash;was consigned to the cemetery of his fathers
  in the parish church of Douglas."</p>

  <p>A nobler death on the field of battle is not recorded in the
  annals of chivalry. In memory of this expedition, the Douglases
  have ever since carried the armorial bearings of the Bloody Heart
  surmounted by the Crown; and a similar distinction is borne by
  another family. Sir Simon of Lee, a distinguished companion of
  Douglas, was the person on whom, after the fall of his leader,
  the custody of the heart devolved. Hence the name of Lockhart,
  and their effigy, the Heart within a Fetterlock.</p>

  <h2>THE BURIAL MARCH OF DUNDEE</h2>

  <p>It is very much to be regretted that no competent person has
  as yet undertaken the task of compiling a full and authentic
  biography of Lord Viscount Dundee. His memory has consequently
  been left at the mercy of misrepresentation and malignity; and
  the pen of romance has been freely employed to portray, as a
  bloody assassin, one of the most accomplished men and gallant
  soldiers of his age.</p>

  <p>It was the misfortune of Claverhouse to have lived in so
  troublous an age and country. The religious differences of
  Scotland were then at their greatest height, and there is hardly
  any act of atrocity and rebellion which had not been committed by
  the insurgents. The royal authority was openly and publicly
  disowned in the western districts: the Archbishop of St.
  Andrew's, after more than one hairbreadth escape, was waylaid,
  and barbarously murdered by an armed gang of fanatics on Magus
  Muir; and his daughter was wounded and maltreated while
  interceding for the old man's life. The country was infested by
  banditti, who took every possible opportunity of shooting down
  and massacring any of the straggling soldiery: the clergy were
  attacked and driven from their houses; so that, throughout a
  considerable portion of Scotland, there was no security either
  for property or for life. It is now the fashion to praise and
  magnify the Covenanters as the most innocent and persecuted of
  men; but those who are so ready with their sympathy, rarely take
  the pains to satisfy themselves, by reference to the annals of
  the time, of the true character of those men whom they blindly
  venerate as martyrs. They forget, in their zeal for religious
  freedom, that even the purest and holiest of causes may be
  sullied and disgraced by the deeds of its upholders, and that a
  wild and frantic profession of faith is not always a test of
  genuine piety. It is not in the slightest degree necessary to
  discuss whether the royal prerogative was at that time
  arbitrarily used, or whether the religious freedom of the nation
  was unduly curtailed. Both points may be, and indeed are,
  admitted,&mdash;for it is impossible to vindicate the policy of
  the measures adopted by the two last monarchs of the house of
  Stuart; but neither admission will clear the Covenanters from the
  stain of deliberate cruelty.</p>

  <p>After the battle of Philiphaugh, the royalist prisoners were
  butchered in cold blood, under the superintendence of a clerical
  emissary, who stood by rubbing his hands, and
  exclaiming&mdash;"The wark gangs bonnily on!" Were I to
  transcribe from the pamphlets before me the list of the murders
  which were perpetrated by the country people on the soldiery,
  officers, and gentlemen of loyal principles, during the reign of
  Charles II., I believe that no candid person would be surprised
  at the severe retaliation which was made. It must be remembered
  that the country was then under military law, and that the
  strongest orders had been issued by the Government to the
  officers in command of the troops, to use every means in their
  power for the effectual repression of the disturbances. The
  necessity of such orders will become apparent, when we reflect
  that, besides the open actions at Aird's Moss and Drumclog, the
  city of Glasgow was attacked, and the royal forces compelled for
  a time to fall back upon Stirling.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances it is no wonder if the soldiery were
  severe in their reprisals. Innocent blood may no doubt have been
  shed, and in some cases even wantonly; for when rebellion has
  grown into civil war, and the ordinary course of the law is put
  in abeyance, it is always impossible to restrain military
  license. But it is most unfair to lay the whole odium of such
  acts upon those who were in command, and to dishonour the fair
  name of gentlemen, by attributing to them personally the
  commission of deeds of which they were absolutely ignorant. To
  this day the peasantry of the western districts of Scotland
  entertain the idea that Claverhouse was a sort of fiend in human
  shape, tall, muscular, and hideous in aspect, secured by infernal
  spells from the chance of perishing by any ordinary weapon, and
  mounted upon a huge black horse, the especial gift of Beelzebub!
  On this charger it is supposed that he could ride up precipices
  as easily as he could traverse the level ground&mdash;that he was
  constantly accompanied by a body of desperadoes, vulgarly known
  by such euphonious titles as "Hell's Tam," and "the De'il's
  Jock," and that his whole time was occupied, day and night, in
  hunting Covenanters upon the hills! Almost every rebel who was
  taken in arms and shot, is supposed to have met his death from
  the individual pistol of Claverhouse; and the tales which, from
  time to time, have been written by such ingenious persons as the
  late Mr. Gait and the Ettrick Shepherd have quietly been assumed
  as facts, and added to the store of our traditionary knowledge.
  It is in vain to hint that the chief commanders of the forces in
  Scotland could have found little leisure, even had they possessed
  the taste, for pursuing single insurgents. Such suggestions are
  an insult to martyrology; and many a parish of the west would be
  indignant were it averred that the tenant of its gray stone had
  suffered by a meaner hand.</p>

  <p>When we look at the portrait of Claverhouse, and survey the
  calm, melancholy, and beautiful features of the devoted soldier,
  it appears almost incredible that he should ever have suffered
  under such an overwhelming load of misrepresentation. But
  when&mdash;discarding modern historians, who in too many
  instances do not seem to entertain the slightest scruple in
  dealing with the memory of the dead&mdash;we turn to the writings
  of his contemporaries who knew the man, his character appears in
  a very different light. They describe him as one who was
  stainless in his honour, pure in his faith, wise in council,
  resolute in action, and utterly free from that selfishness which
  disgraced the Scottish statesmen of the time. No one dares
  question his loyalty, for he sealed that confession with his
  blood; and it is universally admitted, that with him fell the
  last hopes of the reinstatement of the house of Stuart.</p>

  <p>I may perhaps be permitted here, in the absence of a better
  chronicler, to mention a few particulars of his life, which, I
  believe, are comparatively unknown. John Graham of Claverhouse
  was a cadet of the family of Fintrie, connected by intermarriage
  with the blood-royal of Scotland. After completing his studies at
  the University of St. Andrew's, he entered, as was the national
  custom for gentlemen of good birth and limited means, into
  foreign service, served some time in France as a volunteer, and
  afterwards went to Holland. He very soon received a commission,
  as a cornet in a regiment of horse-guards, from the Prince of
  Orange, nephew of Charles II. and James VII., and who afterwards
  married the Princess Mary. His manner at that time is thus
  described:&mdash;"He was then ane esquire, under the title of
  John Graham of Claverhouse; but the vivacity of his parts, and
  the delicacy and justice of his understanding and judgment,
  joyned with a certain vigour of mind and activity of body,
  distinguished him in such a manner from all others of his rank,
  that though he lived in a superior character, yet he acquired the
  love and esteem of all his equals, as well as of those who had
  the advantage of him in dignity and estate."</p>

  <p>By one of those singular accidents which we occasionally meet
  with in history, Graham, afterwards destined to become his most
  formidable opponent, saved the life of the Prince of Orange at
  the battle of St. Neff. The Prince's horse had been killed, and
  he himself was in the grasp of the enemy, when the young cornet
  rode to his rescue, freed him from his assailants, and mounted
  him on his own steed. For this service he received a captain's
  commission, and the promise of the first regiment that should
  fall vacant.</p>

  <p>But even in early life William of Orange was not famous for
  keeping his promises. Some years afterwards, a vacancy in one of
  the Scottish regiments in the Prince's service occurred, and
  Claverhouse, relying upon the previous assurance, preferred his
  claim. It was disregarded, and Mr. Collier, afterwards Earl of
  Portmore, was appointed over his head. It would seem that Graham
  had suspected some foul play on the part of this gentleman, for,
  shortly after, they accidentally met and had an angry
  altercation. This circumstance having come to the ears of the
  Prince, he sent for Captain Graham, and administered a sharp
  rebuke. I give the remainder of this incident in the words of the
  old writer, because it must be considered a very remarkable one,
  as illustrating the fiery spirit and dauntless independence of
  Claverhouse.</p>

  <p>"The Captain answered, that he was indeed in the wrong, since
  it was more his Highness's business to have resented that quarrel
  than his; because Mr. Collier had less injured him in
  disappointing him of the regiment, than he had done his Highness
  in making him break his word. 'Then,' replied the Prince in an
  angry tone, 'I make you full reparation, for I bestow on you what
  is more valuable than a regiment when I give you your right arm!'
  The Captain subjoined, that since his Highness had the goodness
  to give him his liberty, he resolved to employ himself elsewhere,
  for he would not longer serve a Prince that had broken his
  word.</p>

  <p>"The Captain, having thus thrown up his commission, was
  preparing in haste for his voyage, when a messenger arrived from
  the Prince, with two hundred guineas for the horse on which he
  had saved his life. The Captain sent the horse, but ordered the
  gold to be distributed among the grooms of the Prince's stables.
  It is said, however, that his Highness had the generosity to
  write to the King and the Duke, recommending him as a fine
  gentleman and a brave officer, fit for any office, civil or
  military."</p>

  <p>On his arrival in Britain he was well received by the court,
  and immediately appointed to a high military command in Scotland.
  It would be beyond the scope of the present paper to enter
  minutely into the details of his service during the stormy period
  when Scotland was certainly misgoverned, and when there was
  little unity, but much disorder in the land. In whatever point of
  view we regard the history of those times, the aspect is a
  mournful one indeed. Church and State never was a popular cry in
  Scotland, and the peculiar religious tendencies which had been
  exhibited by a large portion of the nation, at the time of the
  Reformation, rendered the return of tranquillity hopeless until
  the hierarchy was displaced, and a humbler form of church
  government, more suited to the feelings of the people,
  substituted in its stead.</p>

  <p>Three years after the accession of James VII. Claverhouse was
  raised to the peerage, by the title of Lord Viscount Dundee. He
  was major-general, and second in command of the royal forces,
  when the Prince of Orange landed, and earnestly entreated King
  James to be allowed to march against him, offering to stake his
  head on the successful result of the enterprize. There is little
  doubt, from the great popularity of Lord Dundee with the army,
  that, had such consent been given, William would have found more
  than a match in his old officer; but the King seemed absolutely
  infatuated, and refused to allow a drop of blood to be shed in
  his quarrel, though the great bulk of the population of England
  were clearly and enthusiastically in his favour. One of the most
  gifted of our modern poets, the Honourable George Sydney Smythe,
  has beautifully illustrated this event.</p>
  <pre>
  "Then out spake gallant Claverhouse, and his soul thrilled wild and high,
  And he showed the King his subjects, and he prayed him not to fly.
  O never yet was captain so dauntless as Dundee!
  He has sworn to chase the Hollander back to his Zuyder-Zee."
</pre>

  <p>But though James quitted his kingdom, the stern loyalty of
  Dundee was nothing moved. Alone, and without escort, he traversed
  England, and presented himself at the Convention of Estates, then
  assembled at Edinburgh for the purpose of receiving the message
  from the Prince of Orange. The meeting was a very strange one.
  Many of the nobility and former members of the Scottish
  Parliament absolutely declined attending it, some on the ground
  that it was not a legal assembly, having been summoned by the
  Prince of Orange, and others because, in such a total disruption
  of order, they judged it safest to abstain from taking any
  prominent part. This gave an immense ascendency to the Revolution
  party, who further proceeded to strengthen their position by
  inviting to Edinburgh large bodies of the armed population of the
  west. After defending for several days the cause of his master
  with as much eloquence as vigour, Dundee, finding that the
  majority of the Convention were resolved to offer the crown of
  Scotland to the Prince, and having moreover received sure
  information that some of the wild fanatic Whigs, with Daniel Ker
  of Kersland at their head, had formed a plot for his
  assassination, quitted Edinburgh with about fifty horsemen, and,
  after a short interview&mdash;celebrated by Sir Walter Scott in
  one of his grandest ballads&mdash;with the Duke of Gordon at the
  Castle Rock, directed his steps towards the north. After a short
  stay at his house of Duddope, during which he received, by order
  of the Council, who were thoroughly alarmed at his absence, a
  summons through a Lyon herald to return to Edinburgh under pain
  of high treason, he passed into the Gordon country, where he was
  joined by the Earl of Dunfermline with a small party of about
  sixty horse. His retreat was timeous, for General Mackay, who
  commanded for the Prince of Orange, had despatched a strong
  force, with instructions to make him prisoner. From this time,
  until the day of his death, he allowed himself no repose.
  Imitating the example, and inheriting the enthusiasm of his great
  predecessor Montrose, he invoked the loyalty of the clans to
  assist him in the struggle for legitimacy&mdash;and he did not
  appeal to them in vain. His name was a spell to rouse the ardent
  spirits of the mountaineers; and not the Great Marquis himself,
  in the height of his renown, was more sincerely welcomed and more
  fondly loved than "Ian dhu nan Cath,"&mdash;Dark John of the
  Battles,&mdash;the name by which Lord Dundee is still remembered
  in Highland song. In the mean time the Convention, terrified at
  their danger, and dreading a Highland inroad, had despatched
  Mackay, a military officer of great experience, with a
  considerable body of troops, to quell the threatened
  insurrection. He was encountered by Dundee, and compelled to
  evacuate the high country and fall back upon the Lowlands, where
  he subsequently received reinforcements, and again marched
  northward. The Highland host was assembled at Blair, though not
  in great force, when the news of Mackay's advance arrived; and a
  council of the chiefs and officers was summoned, to determine
  whether it would be most advisable to fall back upon the glens
  and wild fastnesses of the Highlands, or to meet the enemy at
  once, though with a force far inferior to his.</p>

  <p>Most of the old officers, who had been trained in the foreign
  wars, were of the former opinion&mdash;"alleging that it was
  neither prudent nor cautious to risk an engagement against an
  army of disciplined men, that exceeded theirs in numbers by more
  than a half." But both Glengarry and Locheill, to the great
  satisfaction of the General, maintained the contrary view, and
  argued that neither hunger nor fatigue were so likely to depress
  the Highlanders, as a retreat when the enemy was in view. The
  account of the discussion is so interesting, and so
  characteristic of Dundee, that I shall take leave to quote its
  termination in the words of Drummond of Balhaldy:</p>

  <p>"An advice so hardy and resolute could not miss to please the
  generous Dundee. His looks seemed to heighten with an air of
  delight and satisfaction all the while Locheill was speaking. He
  told his council that they had heard his sentiments from the
  mouth of a person who had formed his judgment upon infallible
  proofs drawn from a long experience, and an intimate acquaintance
  with the persons and subject he spoke of. Not one in the company
  offering to contradict their general, it was unanimously agreed
  to fight.</p>

  <p>"When the news of this vigorous resolution spread through the
  army, nothing was heard but acclamations of joy, which
  exceedingly pleased their gallant general; but before the council
  broke up, Locheill begged to be heard for a few words. 'My Lord'
  said he, 'I have just now declared, in the presence of this
  honourable company, that I was resolved to give an implicit
  obedience to all your Lordship's commands; but I humbly beg
  leave, in name of these gentlemen, to give the word of command
  for this one time. It is the voice of your council, and their
  orders are, that you do not engage personally. Your Lordship's
  business is to have an eye on all parts, and to issue out your
  commands as you shall think proper; it is ours to execute them
  with promptitude and courage. On your Lordship depends the fate,
  not only of this little brave army, but also of our king and
  country. If your Lordship deny us this reasonable demand, for my
  own part I declare, that neither I, nor any I am concerned in,
  shall draw a sword on this important occasion, whatever
  construction shall be put upon the matter.'</p>

  <p>"Locheill was seconded in this by the whole council; but
  Dundee begged leave to be heard in his turn. 'Gentlemen,' said
  he, 'as I am absolutely convinced, and have had repeated proofs,
  of your zeal for the king's service, and of your affection to me
  as his general and your friend, so I am fully sensible that my
  engaging personally this day may be of some loss if I shall
  chance to be killed. But I beg leave of you, however, to allow me
  to give one <i>shear-darg</i> (that is, one harvest-day's work)
  to the king, my master, that I may have an opportunity of
  convincing the brave clans, that I can hazard my life in that
  service as freely as the meanest of them. Ye know their temper,
  gentlemen; and if they do not think I have personal courage
  enough, they will not esteem me hereafter, nor obey my commands
  with cheerfulness. Allow me this single favour, and I here
  promise, upon my honour, never again to risk my person while I
  have that of commanding you.'</p>

  <p>"The council, finding him inflexible, broke up, and the army
  marched directly towards the Pass of Killiecrankie."</p>

  <p>Those who have visited that romantic spot need not be reminded
  of its peculiar features, for these, once seen, must dwell for
  ever in the memory. The lower part of the Pass is a stupendous
  mountain-chasm, scooped out by the waters of the Garry, which
  here descend in a succession of roaring cataracts and pools. The
  old road, which ran almost parallel to the river and close upon
  its edge, was extremely narrow, and wound its way beneath a wall
  of enormous crags, surmounted by a natural forest of birch, oak,
  and pine. An army cooped up in that gloomy ravine would have as
  little chance of escape from the onset of an enterprising
  partisan corps, as had the Bavarian troops when attacked by the
  Tyrolese in the steep defiles of the Inn. General Mackay,
  however, had made his arrangements with consummate tact and
  skill, and had calculated his time so well, that he was enabled
  to clear the Pass before the Highlanders could reach it from the
  other side. Advancing upwards, the passage becomes gradually
  broader, until, just below the House of Urrard, there is a
  considerable width of meadow-land. It was here that Mackay took
  up his position, and arrayed his troops, on observing that the
  heights above were occupied by the army of Dundee.</p>

  <p>The forces of the latter scarcely amounted to one-third of
  those of his antagonist, which were drawn up in line without any
  reserve. He was therefore compelled, in making his dispositions,
  to leave considerable gaps in his own line, which gave Mackay a
  further advantage. The right of Dundee's army was formed of the
  M'Lean, Glengarry, and Clanranald regiments, along with some
  Irish levies. In the centre was Dundee himself, at the head of a
  small and ill-equipped body of cavalry, composed of Lowland
  gentlemen and their followers, and about forty of his old
  troopers. The Camerons and Skyemen, under the command of Locheill
  and Sir Donald Macdonald of Sleat, were stationed on the left.
  During the time occupied by these dispositions, a brisk cannonade
  was opened by Mackay's artillery, which materially increased the
  impatience of the Highlanders to come to close quarters. At last
  the word was given to advance, and the whole line rushed forward
  with the terrific impetuosity peculiar to a charge of the clans.
  They received the fire of the regular troops without flinching,
  reserved their own until they were close at hand, poured in a
  murderous volley, and then, throwing away their firelocks,
  attacked the enemy with the broadsword.</p>

  <p>The victory was almost instantaneous, but it was bought at a
  terrible price. Through some mistake or misunderstanding, a
  portion of the cavalry, instead of following their general, who
  had charged directly for the guns, executed a manoeuvre which
  threw them into disorder; and, when last seen in the battle,
  Dundee, accompanied only by the Earl of Dunfermline and about
  sixteen gentlemen, was entering into the cloud of smoke, standing
  up in his stirrups, and waving to the others to come on. It was
  in this attitude that he appears to have received his
  death-wound. On returning from the pursuit, the Highlanders found
  him dying on the field.</p>

  <p>It would he difficult to point out another instance in which
  the maintenance of a great cause depended solely upon the life of
  a single man. Whilst Dundee survived, Scotland at least was not
  lost to the Stuarts, for, shortly before the battle, he had
  received assurance that the greater part of the organised troops
  in the north were devoted to his person, and ready to join him;
  and the victory of Killiecrankie would have been followed by a
  general rising of the loyal gentlemen in the Lowlands. But with
  his fall the enterprise was over.</p>

  <p>I hope I shall not be accused of exaggerating the importance
  of this battle, which, according to the writer I have already
  quoted, was best proved by the consternation into which the
  opposite party were thrown at the first news of Mackay's defeat.
  "The Duke of Hamilton, commissioner for the parliament which then
  sat at Edinburgh, and the rest of the ministry, were struck with
  such a panic, that some of them were for retiring into England,
  others into the western shires of Scotland, where all the people,
  almost to a man, befriended them; nor knew they whether to
  abandon the government, or to stay a few days until they saw what
  use my Lord Dundee would make of his victory. They knew the
  rapidity of his motions, and were convinced that he would allow
  them no time to deliberate. On this account it was debated,
  whether such of the nobility and gentry as were confined for
  adhering to their old master, should be immediately set at
  liberty or more closely shut up; and though the last was
  determined on, yet the greatest revolutionists among them made
  private and frequent visits to these prisoners, excusing what was
  past, from a fatal necessity of the times, which obliged them to
  give a seeming compliance, but protesting that they always wished
  well to King James, as they should soon have occasion to show
  when my Lord Dundee advanced."</p>

  <p>"The next morning after the battle," says Drummond, "the
  Highland army had more the air of the shattered remains of broken
  troops than of conquerors; for here it was literally true
  that</p>
  <pre>
  'The vanquished triumphed, and the victors mourned.'
</pre>

  <p>The death of their brave general, and the loss of so many of
  their friends, were inexhaustible fountains of grief and sorrow.
  They closed the last scene of this mournful tragedy in obsequies
  of their lamented general, and of the other gentlemen who fell
  with him, and interred them in the church of Blair of Atholl with
  a real funeral solemnity, there not being present one single
  person who did not participate in the general affliction."</p>

  <p>I close this notice of a great soldier and devoted loyalist,
  by transcribing the beautiful epitaph composed by Dr.
  Pitcairn:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
  "Ultime Scotorum! potuit, quo sospite solo,
    Libertas patri&aelig; salva fuisse tu&aelig;:
  Te moriente, novos accepit Scotia cives,
    Accepitque novos, te moriente, deos.
  Illa nequit superesse tibi, tu non potes illi,
    Ergo Caledoni&aelig; nomen inane, vale.
  Tuque vale, gentis prisc&aelig; fortissime ductor,
    Ultime Scotorum, ac ultime Grame, vale!"

      <p>Let the ancient hills of Scotland</p>

      <p class="i2">Hear once more the battle-song</p>

      <p>Swell within their glens and valleys</p>

      <p class="i2">As the clansmen march along!</p>

      <p class="i2">Never from the deadly fray,</p>

      <p>Was a nobler trophy carried</p>

      <p class="i2">Than we bring with us to-day;</p>

      <p>Never, since the valiant Douglas</p>

      <p class="i2">On his dauntless bosom bore</p>

      <p>Good King Robert's heart&mdash;the priceless&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">To our dear Redeemer's shore!</p>

      <p>Lo! we bring with us the hero&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">Lo! we bring the conquering Gr&aelig;me,</p>

      <p>Crowned as best beseems a victor</p>

      <p class="i2">From the altar of his fame;</p>

      <p>Fresh and bleeding from the battle</p>

      <p class="i2">Whence his spirit took its flight,</p>

      <p>Midst the crashing charge of squadrons,</p>

      <p class="i2">And the thunder of the fight!</p>

      <p>Strike, I say, the notes of triumph,</p>

      <p class="i2">As we march o'er moor and lea!</p>

      <p>Is there any here will venture</p>

      <p class="i2">To bewail our dead Dundee?</p>

      <p>Let the widows of the traitors</p>

      <p class="i2">Weep until their eyes are dim!</p>

      <p>Wail ye may full well for Scotland&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i2">Let none dare to mourn for him!</p>

      <p>See! above his glorious body</p>

      <p class="i2">Lies the royal banner's fold&mdash;</p>

      <p>See! his valiant blood is mingled</p>

      <p class="i2">With its crimson and its gold.</p>

      <p>See! how calm he looks and stately,</p>

      <p class="i2">Like a warrior on his shield,</p>

      <p>Waiting till the flush of morning</p>

      <p class="i2">Breaks along the battle-field!</p>

      <p>See&mdash;Oh never more, my comrades!</p>

      <p>Redden with its inward lightning,</p>

      <p class="i2">As the hour of fight drew nigh;</p>

      <p>Never shall we hear the voice that,</p>

      <p class="i2">Clearer than the trumpet's call,</p>

      <p>Bade us strike for King and Country,</p>

      <p class="i2">Bade us win the field or fall!</p>

      <p>On the heights of Killiecrankie</p>

      <p class="i2">Yester-morn our army lay:</p>

      <p>Slowly rose the mist in columns</p>

      <p class="i2">From the river's broken way;</p>

      <p>Hoarsely roared the swollen torrent,</p>

      <p class="i2">And the pass was wrapped in gloom,</p>

      <p>When the clansmen rose together</p>

      <p class="i2">From their lair amidst the broom.</p>

      <p>Then we belted on our tartans,</p>

      <p class="i2">And our bonnets down we drew,</p>

      <p>And we felt our broadswords' edges,</p>

      <p class="i2">And we proved them to be true;</p>

      <p>And we prayed the prayer of soldiers,</p>

      <p class="i2">And we cried the gathering-cry,</p>

      <p>And we clasped the hands of kinsmen,</p>

      <p class="i2">And we swore to do or die!</p>

      <p>Then our leader rode before us</p>

      <p class="i2">On his war-horse black as night&mdash;</p>

      <p>Well the Cameronian rebels</p>

      <p class="i2">Knew that charger in the fight!&mdash;</p>

      <p>And a cry of exultation</p>

      <p class="i2">From the bearded warriors rose;</p>

      <p>For we loved the house of Claver'se,</p>

  <h2>THE WIDOW OF GLENCOE</h2>

  <p>The Massacre of Glencoe is an event which neither can nor
  ought to be forgotten. It was a deed of the worst treason and
  cruelty&mdash;a barbarous infraction of all laws, human and
  divine; and it exhibits in their foulest perfidy the true
  characters of the authors and abettors of the Revolution.</p>

  <p>After the battle of Killiecrankie the cause of the Scottish
  royalists declined, rather from the want of a competent leader
  than from any disinclination on the part of a large section of
  the nobility and gentry to vindicate the right of King James. No
  person of adequate talents or authority was found to supply the
  place of the great and gallant Lord Dundee; for General Cannon,
  who succeeded in command, was not only deficient in military
  skill, but did not possess the confidence, nor understand the
  character of the Highland chiefs, who, with their clansmen,
  constituted by far the most important section of the army.
  Accordingly no enterprise of any importance was attempted; and
  the disastrous issue of the battle of the Boyne led to a
  negotiation which terminated in the entire disbanding of the
  royal forces. By this treaty, which was expressly sanctioned by
  William of Orange, a full and unreserved indemnity and pardon was
  granted to all of the Highlanders who had taken arms, with a
  proviso that they should first subscribe the oath of allegiance
  to William and Mary, before the 1st of January, 1692, in presence
  of the Lords of the Scottish Council, "or of the Sheriffs or
  their deputies of the respective shires wherein they lived." The
  letter of William addressed to the Privy Council, and ordering
  proclamation to be made to the above effect, contained also the
  following significant passage:&mdash;"That ye communicate our
  pleasure to the Governor of Inverlochy, and other commanders,
  that they be exact and diligent in their several posts; but that
  they show no more zeal against the Highlanders after their
  submission, <i>than they have ever done formerly when these were
  in open rebellion</i>."</p>

  <p>This enigmatical sentence, which in reality was intended, as
  the sequel will show, to be interpreted in the most cruel manner,
  appears to have caused some perplexity in the Council, as that
  body deemed it necessary to apply for more distinct and specific
  instructions, which, however, were not then issued. It had been
  especially stipulated by the chiefs, as an indispensable
  preliminary to their treaty, that they should have leave to
  communicate with King James, then residing at St. Germains, for
  the purpose of obtaining his permission and warrant previous to
  submitting themselves to the existing government. That article
  had been sanctioned by William before the proclamation was
  issued, and a special messenger was despatched to France for that
  purpose.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, troops were gradually and cautiously
  advanced to the confines of the Highlands, and, in some
  instances, actually quartered on the inhabitants. The condition
  of the country was perfectly tranquil. No disturbances whatever
  occurred in the north or west of Scotland; Locheill and the other
  chiefs were awaiting the communication from St. Germains, and
  held themselves bound in honour to remain inactive; whilst the
  remainder of the royalist forces (for whom separate terms had
  been made) were left unmolested at Dunkeld.</p>

  <p>But rumours, which are too clearly traceable to the emissaries
  of the new government, asserting the preparation made for an
  immediate landing of King James at the head of a large body of
  the French, were industriously circulated, and by many were
  implicitly believed. The infamous policy which dictated such a
  course is now apparent. The term of the amnesty or truce granted
  by the proclamation expired with the year 1691, and all who had
  not taken the oath of allegiance before that term, were to be
  proceeded against with the utmost severity. The proclamation was
  issued upon the 29th of August: consequently, only four months
  were allowed for the complete submission of the Highlands.</p>

  <p>Not one of the chiefs subscribed until the mandate from King
  James arrived. That document, which is dated from St. Germains on
  the 12th of December 1691, reached Dunkeld eleven days
  afterwards, and, consequently, but a very short time before the
  indemnity expired. The bearer, Major Menzies, was so fatigued
  that he could proceed no farther on his journey, but forwarded
  the mandate by an express to the commander of the royal forces,
  who was then at Glengarry. It was therefore impossible that the
  document could be circulated through the Highlands within the
  prescribed period. Locheill, says Drummond of Balhaldy, did not
  receive his copy till about thirty hours before the time was out,
  and appeared before the sheriff at Inverara, where he took the
  oaths upon the very day on which the indemnity expired.</p>

  <p>That a general massacre throughout the Highlands was
  contemplated by the Whig government, is a fact established by
  overwhelming evidence. In the course of the subsequent
  investigation before the Scots Parliament, letters were produced
  from Sir John Dalrymple, then Master of Stair, one of the
  secretaries of state in attendance upon the court, which too
  clearly indicate the intentions of William. In one of these,
  dated 1st December 1694,&mdash;<i>a month</i>, be it observed,
  before the amnesty expired&mdash;and addressed to
  Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, there are the following
  words:&mdash;"The winter is the only season in which we are sure
  the Highlanders cannot escape us, <i>nor carry their wives,
  bairns</i>, and cattle to the mountains." And in another letter,
  written only two days afterwards, he says, "It is the only time
  that they cannot escape you, for human constitution cannot endure
  to be long out of houses. <i>This is the proper season to maule
  them, in the cold long nights</i>." And in January thereafter, he
  informed Sir Thomas Livingston that the design was "to destroy
  entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheill's lands, Keppoch's,
  Glengarry's, Appin, and Glencoe. I assure you," he continues,
  "your power shall be full enough, <i>and I hope the soldiers will
  not trouble the Government with prisoners</i>."</p>

  <p>Locheill was more fortunate than others of his friends and
  neighbours. According to Drummond,&mdash;"Major Menzies, who,
  upon his arrival, had observed the whole forces of the kingdom
  ready to invade the Highlands, as he wrote to General Buchan,
  foreseeing the unhappy consequences, not only begged that general
  to send expresses to all parts with orders immediately to submit,
  but also wrote to Sir Thomas Livingston, praying him to
  supplicate the Council for a prorogation of the time, in regard
  that he was so excessively fatigued, that he was obliged to stop
  some days to repose a little; and that though he should send
  expresses, yet it was impossible they could reach the distant
  parts in such time as to allow the several persons concerned the
  benefit of the indemnity within the space limited; besides, that
  some persons having put the Highlanders in a bad temper, he was
  confident to persuade them to submit, if a further time were
  allowed. Sir Thomas presented this letter to the Council on the
  5th of January, 1692, but they refused to give any answer, and
  ordered him to transmit the same to Court."</p>

  <p>The reply of William of Orange was a letter, countersigned by
  Dalrymple, in which, upon the recital that "several of the
  chieftains and many of their clans had not taken the benefit of
  our gracious indemnity," he gave orders for a general massacre.
  "To that end, we have given Sir Thomas Livingston orders to
  employ our troops (which we have already conveniently posted) to
  cut off these obstinate rebels <i>by all manner of hostility</i>;
  and we do require you to give him your assistance and concurrence
  in all other things that may conduce to that service; and because
  these rebels, to avoid our forces, may draw themselves, <i>their
  families</i>, goods, or cattle, to lurk or be concealed among
  their neighbours: therefore, we require and authorise you to emit
  a proclamation to be published at the market-crosses of these or
  the adjacent shires where the rebels reside, discharging upon the
  highest penalties the law allows, any reset, correspondence, or
  intercommuning with these rebels." This monstrous mandate, which
  was in fact the death-warrant of many thousand innocent people,
  no distinction being made of age or sex, would, in all human
  probability, have been put into execution, but for the
  remonstrance of one high-minded nobleman. Lord Carmarthen,
  afterwards Duke of Leeds, accidentally became aware of the
  proposed massacre, and personally remonstrated with the monarch
  against a measure which he denounced as at once cruel and
  impolitic. After much discussion, William, influenced rather by
  an apprehension that so savage and sweeping an act might prove
  fatal to his new authority, than by any compunction or impulse of
  humanity, agreed to recall the general order, and to limit
  himself, in the first instance, to a single deed of butchery, by
  way of testing the temper of the nation. Some difficulty seems to
  have arisen in the selection of the fittest victim. Both Keppoch
  and Glencoe were named, but the personal rancour of Secretary
  Dalrymple decided the doom of the latter. The Secretary wrote
  thus:&mdash;"Argyle tells me that Glencoe hath not taken the
  oath, at which I rejoice. It is a great work of charity to be
  exact in rooting out that damnable set." The final instructions
  regarding Glencoe, which were issued on 16th January, 1692, are
  as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
  "William R.&mdash;As for M'Ian of Glencoe, and that tribe,
  if they can be well distinguished from the rest of the
  Highlanders, it will be proper for public justice to extirpate
  that set of thieves."                                   "W.R."
</pre>

  <p>This letter is remarkable as being signed and countersigned by
  William alone, contrary to the usual practice. The Secretary was
  no doubt desirous to screen himself from after responsibility,
  and was further aware that the royal signature would insure a
  rigorous execution of the sentence.</p>

  <p>Macdonald, or, as he was more commonly designed, M'Ian of
  Glencoe, was the head of a considerable sept or branch of the
  great Clan-Coila, and was lineally descended from the ancient
  Lords of the Isles, and from the royal family of
  Scotland&mdash;the common ancestor of the Macdonalds having
  espoused a daughter of Robert II. He was, according to a
  contemporary testimony, "a person of great integrity, honour,
  good nature, and courage; and his loyalty to his old master, King
  James, was such, that he continued in arms from Dundee's first
  appearing in the Highlands, till the fatal treaty that brought on
  his ruin." In common with the other chiefs, he had omitted taking
  the benefit of the indemnity until he received the sanction of
  King James: but the copy of that document which was forwarded to
  him, unfortunately arrived too late. The weather was so
  excessively stormy at the time that there was no possibility of
  penetrating from Glencoe to Inverara, the place where the sheriff
  resided, before the expiry of the stated period; and M'Ian
  accordingly adopted the only practicable mode of signifying his
  submission, by making his way with great difficulty to
  Fort-William, then called Inverlochy, and tendering his signature
  to the military Governor there. That officer was not authorised
  to receive it, but at the earnest entreaty of the chief, he gave
  him a certificate of his appearance and tender, and on New-Year's
  day, 1692, M'Ian reached Inverara, where he produced that paper
  as evidence of his intentions, and prevailed upon the sheriff,
  Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglass, to administer the oaths
  required. After that ceremony, which was immediately intimated to
  the Privy Council, had been performed, the unfortunate gentleman
  returned home, in the full conviction that he had thereby made
  peace with government for himself and for his clan. But his doom
  was already sealed.</p>

  <p>A company of the Earl of Argyle's regiment had been previously
  quartered in Glencoe. These men, though Campbells, and
  hereditarily obnoxious to the Macdonalds, Camerons, and other of
  the loyal clans, were yet countrymen, and were kindly and
  hospitably received. Their captain, Robert Campbell of Glenlyon,
  was connected with the family of Glencoe through the marriage of
  a niece, and was resident under the roof of the chief. And yet
  this was the very troop selected for the horrid service.</p>

  <p>Special instructions were sent to the major of the regiment,
  one Duncanson, then quartered at Ballachulish&mdash;a morose,
  brutal, and savage man&mdash;who accordingly wrote to Campbell of
  Glenlyon in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

                      Ballacholis, 12 <i>February</i>, 1692.

  "SIR,&mdash;You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebels,
  the M'Donalds of Glencoe, and putt all to the sword under
  seventy. You are to have special care that the old fox and
  his sons doe upon no account escape your hands. You are
  to secure all the avenues, that no man escape. This you
  are to put in execution att five o'clock in the morning
  precisely, and by that time, or very shortly after it, I'll
  strive to be att you with a stronger party. If I doe not
  come to you at five, you are not to tarry for me, but to fall
  on. This is by the king's speciall command, for the good
  and safety of the country, that these miscreants be cutt off
  root and branch. See that this be putt in execution without
  feud or favour, else you may expect to be treated as not
  true to the king's government, nor a man fitt to carry a
  commission in the king's service. Expecting you will not
  faill in the fulfilling hereof as you love yourself, I subscribe
  these with my hand."                    ROBERT DUNCANSON.
</pre>
  <pre>
      "<i>For their Majestys' service.
  To Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon</i>."
</pre>

  <p>This order was but too literally obeyed. At the appointed
  hour, when the whole inhabitants of the glen were asleep, the
  work of murder began. M'Ian was one of the first who fell.
  Drummond's narrative fills up the remainder of the dreadful
  story.</p>

  <p>"They then served all within the family in the same manner,
  without distinction of age or person. In a word&mdash;for the
  horror of that execrable butchery must give pain to the
  reader&mdash;they left none alive but a young child, who, being
  frightened with the noise of the guns, and the dismal shrieks and
  cries of its dying parents, whom they were a-murdering, got hold
  of Captain Campbell's knees, and wrapt itself within his cloak;
  by which, chancing to move compassion, the captain inclined to
  have saved it, but one Drummond, an officer, arriving about the
  break of day with more troops, commanded it to be shot by a file
  of musqueteers. Nothing could be more shocking and horrible than
  the prospect of these houses bestrewed with mangled bodies of the
  dead, covered with blood, and resounding with the groans of
  wretches in the last agonies of life.</p>

  <p>"Two sons of Glencoe's were the only persons that escaped in
  that quarter of the country; for, growing jealous of some ill
  designs from the behaviour of the soldiers, they stole from their
  beds a few minutes before the tragedy began, and, chancing to
  overhear two of them discoursing plainly of the matter, they
  endeavoured to have advertised their father, but, finding that
  impracticable, they ran to the other end of the country and
  alarmed the inhabitants. There was another accident that
  contributed much to their safety; for the night was so
  excessively stormy and tempestuous, that four hundred soldiers,
  who were appointed to murder these people, were stopped in their
  march from Inverlochy, and could not get up till they had time to
  save themselves. To cover the deformity of so dreadful a sight,
  the soldiers burned all the houses to the ground, after having
  rifled them, carried away nine hundred cows, two hundred horses,
  numberless herds of sheep and goats, and every thing else that
  belonged to these miserable people. Lamentable was the case of
  the women and children that escaped the butchery; the mountains
  were covered with a deep snow, the rivers impassable, storm and
  tempest filled the air and added to the horrors and darkness of
  the night, and there were no houses to shelter them within many
  miles."[<a href="#note-1">1</a>]</p>

  <p>Such was the awful massacre of Glencoe, an event which has
  left an indelible and execrable stain upon the memory of William
  of Orange. The records of Indian warfare can hardly afford a
  parallel instance of atrocity: and this deed, coupled with his
  deliberate treachery in the Darien scheme, whereby Scotland was
  for a time absolutely ruined, is sufficient to account for the
  little estimation in which the name of the "great Whig deliverer"
  is still regarded in the valleys of the North.</p>

  <h2>THE ISLAND OF THE SCOTS</h2>

  <p>In consequence of a capitulation with Government, the regular
  troops who had served under Lord Dundee were transhipped to
  France, and, immediately upon their landing, the officers and
  others had their rank confirmed according to the tenor of the
  commissions and characters which they bore in Scotland. They were
  distributed throughout the different garrisons in the north of
  France, and, though nominally in the service of King James,
  derived their whole means of subsistence from the bounty of the
  French monarch. So long as it appeared probable that another
  descent was meditated, those gentlemen, who were almost without
  exception men of considerable family, assented to this
  arrangement, but the destruction of the French fleet under
  Admiral Tourville, off La Hogue, led to a material change in
  their views. After that naval engagement it became obvious that
  the cause of the fugitive King was in the mean time desperate,
  and the Scottish officers, with no less gallantry than honour,
  volunteered a sacrifice which, so far as I know, has hardly been
  equalled.</p>

  <p>The old and interesting pamphlet written by one of the
  corps,[<a href="#note-2">2</a>] from which I have extracted most
  of the following details, but which is seldom perused except by
  the antiquary, states that, "The Scottish officers, considering
  that, by the loss of the French Fleet, King James's restoration
  would be retarded for some time, and that they were burdensome to
  the King of France, being entertained in garrisons on whole pay,
  without doing duty, when he had almost all Europe in confederacy
  against him, therefore humbly entreated King James to have them
  reduced into a company of private sentinels, and choose officers
  amongst themselves to command them, assuring his majesty that
  they would serve in the meanest circumstances, and undergo the
  greatest hardships and fatigues that reason could imagine, or
  misfortunes inflict, until it pleased God to restore him. King
  James commended their generosity and loyalty, but disapproved of
  what they proposed, and told them it was impossible that
  gentlemen who had served in so honourable posts as formerly they
  had enjoyed, and lived in so great plenty and ease, could ever
  undergo the fatigue and hardships of private sentinels' duty.
  Again, that his own first command was a company of officers,
  whereof several died, others, wearied with fatigue, drew their
  discharges, till at last it dwindled into nothing, and he got no
  reputation by the command: therefore he desired them to insist no
  more on that project. The officers (notwithstanding his majesty's
  desire to the contrary) made several interests at court, and
  harassed him so much, that at last he condescended," and
  appointed those who were to command them.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards the new corps was reviewed for the first
  and last time by the unfortunate James in the gardens of Saint
  Germains, and the tears are said to have gushed from his eyes at
  the sight of so many brave men, reduced, through their
  disinterested and persevering loyalty, to so very humble a
  condition. "Gentlemen," said he, "my own misfortunes are not so
  nigh my heart as yours. It grieves me beyond what I can express
  to see so many brave and worthy gentlemen, who had once the
  prospect of being the chief officers in my army, reduced to the
  stations of private sentinels. Nothing but your loyalty, and that
  of a few of my subjects in Britain, who are forced from their
  allegiance by the Prince of Orange, and who, I know, will be
  ready on all occasions to serve me and my distressed family,
  could make me willing to live. The sense of what all of you have
  done and undergone for your loyalty hath made so deep an
  impression upon my heart, that, if it ever please God to restore
  me, it is impossible I can be forgetful of your services and
  sufferings. Neither can there be any posts in the armies of my
  dominions but what you have just pretensions to. As for my son,
  your Prince, he is of your own blood, a child capable of any
  impression, and, as his education will be from you, it is not
  supposable that he can forget your merits. At your own desires
  you are now going a long march far distant from me. Fear God and
  love one another. Write your wants particularly to me, and depend
  upon it always to find me your parent and King." The scene bore a
  strong resemblance to one which many years afterwards occurred at
  Fontainebleau. The company listened to his words with deep
  emotion, gathered round him, as if half repentant of their own
  desire to go, and so parted, for ever on this earth, the
  dethroned monarch and his exiled subjects.</p>

  <p>The number of this company of officers was about one hundred
  and twenty: their destination was Perpignan in Rousillon, close
  upon the frontier of Spain, where they were to join the army
  under the command of the Mareschal de Noailles. Their power of
  endurance, though often most severely tested in an unwholesome
  climate, seems to have been no less remarkable than their
  gallantry, which upon many occasions called forth the warm
  acknowledgment of the French commanders. "<i>Le gentilhomme</i>,"
  said one of the generals, in acknowledgment of their readiness at
  a peculiarly critical moment, "<i>est toujours gentilhomme, et se
  montre toujours tel dans besoin et dans le danger</i>"&mdash;a
  eulogy as applicable to them as it was in later days to La Tour
  d'Auvergne, styled the first grenadier of France. At Perpignan
  they were joined by two other Scottish companies, and the three
  seem to have continued to serve together for several
  campaigns.</p>

  <p>As a proof of the estimation in which they were held, I shall
  merely extract a short account of the taking of Rosas in
  Catalonia, before referring to the exploit which forms the
  subject of the following ballad. "On the 27th of May, the company
  of officers and other Scottish companies, were joined by two
  companies of Irish, to make up a battalion in order to mount the
  trenches; and the major part of the officers listed themselves in
  the company of grenadiers, under the command of the brave Major
  Rutherford, who, on his way to the trenches, in sight of
  Mareschal de Noailles and his court, marched with his company on
  the side of the trench, which exposed him to the fire of a
  bastion, where there were two culverins and several other guns
  planted; likewise to the fire of two curtins lined with small
  shot. Colonel Brown, following with the battalion, was obliged,
  in honour, to march the same way Major Rutherford had done; the
  danger whereof the Mareschal immediately perceiving, ordered one
  of his aides-de-camp to command Rutherford to march under cover
  of the trench, which he did; and if he had but delayed six
  minutes, the grenadiers and battalion had been cut to pieces.
  Rutherford, with his grenadiers, marched to a trench near the
  town, and the battalion to a trench on the rear and flank of the
  grenadiers, who fired so incessantly on the besieged, that they
  thought (the trench being practicable) they were going to make
  their attacks, immediately beat a chamade, and were willing to
  give up the town upon reasonable terms: but the Mareschal's
  demands were so exorbitant, that the Governor could not agree to
  them. Then firing began on both sides to be very hot; and they in
  the town, seeing how the grenadiers lay, killed eight of them.
  When the Governor surrendered the town, he inquired of the
  Mareschal what countrymen these grenadiers were; and assured him
  it was on their account he delivered up the town, because they
  fired so hotly, that he believed they were resolved to attack the
  breach. He answered, smiling, <i>'Ces sont mes
  enfants</i>&mdash;They are my children.' Again; 'they are the
  King of Great Britain's Scottish officers, who, to show their
  willingness to share of his miseries, have reduced themselves to
  the carrying of arms, and chosen to serve under my command.' The
  next day, when the Mareschal rode along the front of the camp, he
  halted at the company of the officers' piquet, and they all
  surrounded him. Then, with his hat in his hand, he thanked them
  for their good services in the trenches, and freely acknowledged
  it was their conduct and courage which compelled the Governor to
  give up the town; and assured them he would acquaint his master
  with the same, which he did. For when his son arrived with the
  news at Versailles, the King, having read the letter, immediately
  took coach to St. Germains; and when he had shown King James the
  letter, he thanked him for the services his subjects had done in
  taking Rosas in Catalonia; who, with concern, replied, they were
  the stock of his British officers, and that he was sorry he could
  not make better provision for them."</p>

  <p>And a miserable provision it was! They were gradually
  compelled to part with every remnant of the property which they
  had secured from the ruins of their fortunes; so that when they
  arrived, after various adventures, at Scelestat, in Alsace, they
  were literally without the common means of subsistence. Famine
  and the sword had, by this time, thinned their ranks, but had not
  diminished their spirit, as the following narrative of their last
  exploit will show:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In December 1697, General Stirk, who commanded for the
  Germans, appeared with 16,000 men on the other side of the Rhine,
  which obliged the Marquis de Sell to draw out all the garrisons
  in Alsace, who made up about 4000 men; and he encamped on the
  other side of the Rhine, over against General Stirk, to prevent
  his passing the Rhine and carrying a bridge over into an island
  in the middle of it, which the French foresaw would be of great
  prejudice to them. For the enemy's guns, placed on that island,
  would extremely gall their camp, which they could not hinder for
  the deepness of the water and their wanting of boats&mdash;for
  which the Marquis quickly sent; but arriving too late, the
  Germans had carried a bridge over into the island, where they had
  posted above five hundred men, who, by order of their engineers,
  intrenched themselves: which the company of officers perceiving,
  who always grasped after honour, and scorned all thoughts of
  danger, resolved to wade the river, and attack the Germans in the
  island; and for that effect, desired Captain John Foster, who
  then commanded them, to beg of the Marquis that they might have
  liberty to attack the Germans in the island; who told Captain
  Foster, when the boats came up, they should be the first that
  attacked. Foster courteously thanked the Marquis, and told him
  they would wade into the island, who shrunk up his shoulders,
  prayed God to bless them, and desired them to do what they
  pleased." Whereupon the officers, with the other two Scottish
  companies, made themselves ready; and having secured their arms
  round their necks, waded into the river hand-in-hand, "according
  to the Highland fashion," with the water as high as their
  breasts; and having crossed the heavy stream, fell upon the
  Germans in their intrenchment. These were presently thrown into
  confusion, and retreated, breaking down their own bridges, whilst
  many of them were drowned. This movement, having been made in the
  dusk of the evening, partook of the character of a surprise; but
  it appears to me a very remarkable one, as having been effected
  under such circumstances, in the dead of winter, and in the face
  of an enemy who possessed the advantages both of position and of
  numerical superiority. The author of the narrative
  adds:&mdash;"When the Marquis de Sell heard the firing, and
  understood that the Germans were beat out of the island, he made
  the sign of the cross on his face and breast, and declared
  publicly, that it was the bravest action that ever he saw, and
  that his army had no honour by it. As soon as the boats came, the
  Marquis sent into the island to acquaint the officers that he
  would send them both troops and provisions, who thanked his
  Excellency, and desired he should be informed that they wanted no
  troops, and could not spare time to make use of provisions, and
  only desired spades, shovels, and pickaxes, wherewith they might
  intrench themselves&mdash;which were immediately sent to them.
  The next morning, the Marquis came into the island, and kindly
  embraced every officer, and thanked them for the good service
  they had done his master, assuring them he would write a true
  account of their honour and bravery to the Court of France,
  which, at the reading his letters, immediately went to St.
  Germains, and thanked King James for the services his subjects
  had done on the Rhine."</p>

  <p>The company kept possession of the island for nearly six
  weeks, notwithstanding repeated attempts on the part of the
  Germans to surprise and dislodge them; but all these having been
  defeated by the extreme watchfulness of the Scots, General Stirk
  at length drew off his army and retreated. "In consequence of
  this action," says the chronicler, "that island is called at
  present Isle d'Ecosse, and will in likelihood bear that name
  until the general conflagration."</p>

  <p>Two years afterwards, a treaty of peace was concluded; and
  this gallant company of soldiers, worthy of a better fate, was
  broken up and dispersed. At the time when the narrative, from
  which I have quoted so freely, was compiled, not more than
  sixteen of Dundee's veterans were alive. The author concludes
  thus,&mdash;"And thus was dissolved one of the best companies
  that ever marched under command! Gentlemen, who, in the midst of
  all their pressures and obscurity, never forgot they were
  gentlemen; and whom the sweets of a brave, a just, and honourable
  conscience, rendered perhaps more happy under those sufferings,
  than the most prosperous and triumphant in iniquity, since our
  minds stamp our happiness."</p>

  <p>Some years ago, while visiting the ancient Scottish convent at
  Ratisbon, my attention was drawn to the monumental inscriptions
  on the walls of the dormitory, many of which bear reference to
  gentlemen of family and distinction, whose political principles
  had involved them in the troubles of 1688, 1715, and 1745.
  Whether the cloister which now holds their dust had afforded them
  a shelter in the later years of their misfortunes, I know not;
  but for one that is so commemorated, hundreds of the exiles must
  have passed away in obscurity, buried in the field on which they
  fell, or carried from the damp vaults of the military hospital to
  the trench, without any token of remembrance, or any other wish
  beyond that which the minstrels have ascribed to one of the
  greatest of our olden heroes&mdash;</p>

  "Oh bury me by the bracken bush,
    Beneath the blooming brier:
  Let never living mortal ken
    That a kindly Scot lies here!"

  <h2>CHARLES EDWARD AT VERSAILLES</h2>

  <p>Though the sceptre had departed from the House of Stuart, it
  was reserved for one of its last descendants to prove to the
  world, by his personal gallantry and noble spirit of enterprise,
  that he at least had not degenerated from his royal line of
  ancestors. The daring effort of Charles Edward to recover the
  crown of these kingdoms for his father, is to us the most
  remarkable incident of the last century. It was honourable alike
  to the Prince and to those who espoused his cause; and, even in a
  political point of view, the outbreak ought not to be deplored,
  since its failure put an end for ever to the dynastical struggle
  which, for more than half a century, had agitated the whole of
  Britain, established the rule of law and of social order
  throughout the mountainous districts of Scotland, and blended
  Celt and Saxon into one prosperous and united people. It was
  better that the antiquated system of clanship should have expired
  in a blaze of glory, than gradually dwindled into contempt;
  better that the patriarchal rule should at once have been
  extinguished by the dire catastrophe of Culloden, than that it
  should have lingered on, the shadow of an old tradition. There is
  nothing now to prevent us from dwelling with pride and admiration
  on the matchless devotion displayed by the Highlanders, in 1745,
  in behalf of the heir of him whom they acknowledged as their
  lawful king. No feeling can arise to repress the interest and the
  sympathy which is excited by the perusal of the tale narrating
  the sufferings of the princely wanderer. That un-bought loyalty
  and allegiance of the heart, which would not depart from its
  constancy until the tomb of the Vatican had closed upon the last
  of the Stuart line, has long since been transferred to the
  constitutional sovereign of these realms; and the enthusiastic
  welcome which has so often greeted the return of Queen Victoria
  to her Highland home, owes its origin to a deeper feeling than
  that dull respect which modern liberalism asserts to be the only
  tribute due to the first magistrate of the land.</p>

  <p>The campaign of 1745 yields in romantic interest to none which
  is written in history. A young and inexperienced prince, whose
  person was utterly unknown to any of his adherents, landed on the
  west coast of Scotland, not at the head of a foreign force, not
  munimented with supplies and arms, but accompanied by a mere
  handful of followers, and ignorant of the language of the people
  amongst whom he was hazarding his person. His presence in
  Scotland had not been urged by the chiefs of the clans, most of
  whom were deeply averse to embarking in an enterprise which must
  involve them in a war with so powerful an antagonist as England,
  and which, if unsuccessful, could only terminate in the utter
  ruin of their fortunes. This was not a cause in which the whole
  of Scotland was concerned. Although it was well known that many
  leading families in the Lowlands entertained Jacobite opinions,
  and although a large proportion of the common people had not yet
  become reconciled to, or satisfied of, the advantages of the
  Union, by which they considered themselves dishonoured and
  betrayed, it was hardly to be expected that, without some fair
  guarantee for success, the bulk of the Scottish nation would
  actively bestir themselves on the side of the exiled family.
  Besides this, even amongst the Highlanders there was not
  unanimity of opinion. The three northern clans of Sutherland,
  Mackay, and Monro, were known to be staunch supporters of the
  Government. It was doubtful what part might be taken in the
  struggle by those of Mackenzie and Ross. The chiefs of Skye, who
  could have brought a large force of armed men into the field, had
  declined participating in the attempt. The assistance of Lord
  Lovat, upon whom the co-operation of the Frasers might depend,
  could not be calculated on with certainty; and nothing but
  hostility could be expected from the powerful sept of the
  Campbells. Under such circumstances, it is little wonder if
  Cameron of Locheill, the most sagacious of all the chieftains who
  favoured the Stuart cause, was struck with consternation and
  alarm at the news of the Prince's landing, or that he attempted
  to persuade him from undertaking an adventure so seemingly
  hopeless. Mr. Robert Chambers, in his admirable history of that
  period, does not in the least exaggerate the importance of the
  interview, on the result of which the prosecution of the war
  depended. "On arriving at Borrodale, Locheill had a private
  interview with the Prince, in which the probabilities of the
  enterprise were anxiously debated. Charles used every argument to
  excite the loyalty of Locheill, and the chief exerted all his
  eloquence to persuade the Prince to withdraw till a better
  opportunity. Charles represented the present as the best possible
  opportunity, seeing that the French general kept the British army
  completely engaged abroad, while at home there were no troops but
  one or two newly-raised regiments. He expressed his confidence
  that a small body of Highlanders would be sufficient to gain a
  victory over all the force that could now be brought against him;
  and he was equally sure that such an advantage was all that was
  required to make his friends at home declare in his favour, and
  cause those abroad to send him assistance. All he wanted was that
  the Highlanders should begin the war. Locheill still resisted,
  entreating Charles to be more temperate, and consent to remain
  concealed where he was, till his friends should meet together and
  concert what was best to be done. Charles, whose mind was wound
  up to the utmost pitch of impatience, paid no regard to this
  proposal, but answered that he was determined to put all to the
  hazard. 'In a few days,' said he, 'with the few friends I have, I
  will raise the royal standard, and proclaim to the people of
  Britain that Charles Stuart is come over to claim the crown of
  his ancestors&mdash;to win it, or to perish in the attempt!
  Locheill&mdash;who, my father has often told me, was our firmest
  friend&mdash;may stay at home, and learn from the newspapers the
  fate of his Prince!' 'No!' said Locheill, stung by so poignant a
  reproach, and hurried away by the enthusiasm of the moment; 'I
  will share the fate of my Prince, and so shall every man over
  whom nature or fortune has given me any power.' Such was the
  juncture upon which depended the civil war of 1745; for it is a
  point agreed, says Mr. Home, who narrates this conversation, that
  if Locheill had persisted in his refusal to take arms, no other
  chief would have joined the standard, and the spark of rebellion
  must have been instantly extinguished." Not more than twelve
  hundred men were assembled in Glenfinnan on the day when the
  standard was unfurled by the Marquis of Tullibardine, and, at the
  head of this mere handful of followers, Charles Edward commenced
  the stupendous enterprise of reconquering the dominions of his
  fathers.</p>

  <p>With a force which, at the battle of Preston, did not double
  the above numbers, the Prince descended upon the Lowlands, having
  baffled the attempts of General Cope to intercept his
  march&mdash;occupied the city of Perth and the town of Dundee,
  and finally, after a faint show of resistance on the part of the
  burghers, took possession of the ancient capital of Scotland, and
  once more established a court in the halls of Holyrood. His
  youth, his gallantry, and the grace and beauty of his person,
  added to a most winning and affable address, acquired for him the
  sympathy of many who, from political motives, abstained from
  becoming his adherents. Possibly certain feelings of nationality,
  which no deliberate views of civil or religious policy could
  altogether extirpate, led such men to regard, with a sensation
  akin to pride, the spectacle of a prince descended from the long
  line of Scottish kings, again occupying his ancestral seat, and
  restoring to their country, which had been utterly neglected by
  the new dynasty, a portion of its former state. No doubt a sense
  of pity for the probable fate of one so young and chivalrous was
  often present to their minds, for they had thorough confidence in
  the intrepidity of the regular troops, and in the capacity of
  their commander; and they never for a moment supposed that these
  could be successfully encountered by a raw levy of undisciplined
  Highlanders, ill-armed and worse equipped, and without the
  support of any artillery.</p>

  <p>The issue of the battle of Prestonpans struck Edinburgh with
  amazement. In point of numbers the two armies were nearly equal,
  but in every thing else, save personal valour, the royal troops
  had the advantage. And yet, <i>in four minutes</i>&mdash;for the
  battle is said not to have lasted longer&mdash;the Highlanders
  having only made one terrific and impetuous charge&mdash;the rout
  of the regulars was general. The infantry was broken and cut to
  pieces; the dragoons, who behaved shamefully on the occasion,
  turned bridle and fled, without having once crossed swords with
  the enemy. Mr. Chambers thus terminates his account of the
  action: "The general result of the battle of Preston may be
  stated as having been the total overthrow and almost entire
  destruction of the royal army. Most of the infantry, falling upon
  the park walls of Preston, were there huddled together, without
  the power of resistance, into a confused drove, and had either to
  surrender or to be cut to pieces. Many, in vainly attempting to
  climb over the walls, fell an easy prey to the ruthless claymore.
  Nearly 400, it is said, were thus slain, 700 taken, while only
  about 170 in all succeeded in effecting their escape.</p>

  <p>"The dragoons, with worse conduct, were much more fortunate.
  In falling back, they had the good luck to find outlets from
  their respective positions by the roads which ran along the
  various extremities of the park wall, and they thus got clear
  through the village with little slaughter; after which, as the
  Highlanders had no horse to pursue them, they were safe. Several
  officers, among whom were Fowkes and Lascelles, escaped to
  Cockenzie and along Seton Sands, in a direction contrary to the
  general flight.</p>

  <p>"The unfortunate Cope had attempted, at the first break of
  Gardiner's dragoons, to stop and rally them, but was borne
  headlong, with the confused bands, through the narrow road to the
  south of the enclosures, notwithstanding all his efforts to the
  contrary. On getting beyond the village, where he was joined by
  the retreating bands of the other regiment, he made one anxious
  effort, with the Earls of Loudoun and Home, to form and bring
  them back to charge the enemy, now disordered by the pursuit; but
  in vain. They fled on, ducking their heads along their horses'
  necks to escape the bullets which the pursuers occasionally sent
  after them. By using great exertions, and holding pistols to the
  heads of the troopers, Sir John and a few of his officers induced
  a small number of them to halt in a field near St. Clement's
  Wells, about two miles from the battle-ground. But, after a
  momentary delay, the accidental firing of a pistol renewed the
  panic, and they rode off once more in great disorder. Sir John
  Cope, with a portion of them, reached Channelkirk at an early
  hour in the forenoon, and there halted to breakfast, and to write
  a brief note to one of the state-officers, relating the fate of
  the day. He then resumed his flight, and reached Coldstream that
  night. Next morning he proceeded to Berwick, whose fortifications
  seemed competent to give the security he required. He everywhere
  brought the first tidings of his own defeat."</p>

  <p>This victory operated very much in favour of Prince Charles.
  It secured him, for a season, the undisputed possession of
  Scotland, and enabled numerous adherents from all parts of the
  country to raise such forces as they could command, and to repair
  to his banner. His popularity in Edinburgh daily increased, as
  the qualities of his person and mind became known; and such
  testimony as the following, with respect to his estimation by the
  fair sex, and the devotion they exhibited in his cause, is not
  overcharged. "His affability and great personal grace wrought him
  high favour with the ladies, who, as we learn from, the letters
  of President Forbes, became generally so zealous in his cause, as
  to have some serious effect in inducing their admirers to declare
  for the Prince. There was, we know for certain, a Miss Lumsden,
  who plainly told her lover, a young artist, named Robert Strange,
  that he might think no more of her unless he should immediately
  join Prince Charles, and thus actually prevailed upon him to take
  up arms. It may be added that he survived the enterprise, escaped
  with great difficulty, and married the lady. He was afterwards
  the best line-engraver of his time, and received the honour of
  knighthood from George III. White ribbons and breastknots became
  at this time conspicuous articles of female attire in private
  assemblies. The ladies also showed considerable zeal in
  contributing plate and other articles for the use of the
  Chevalier at the palace, and in raising pecuniary subsidies for
  him. Many a posset-dish and snuff-box, many a treasured necklace
  and repeater, many a jewel which had adorned its successive
  generations of family beauties, was at this time sold or laid in
  pledge, to raise a little money for the service of Prince
  Charlie."</p>

  <p>As to the motives and intended policy of this remarkable and
  unfortunate young man, it may be interesting to quote the terms
  of the proclamation which he issued on the 10th October, 1745,
  before commencing his march into England. Let his history be
  impartially read, his character, as spoken to by those who knew
  him best, fairly noted, and I think there cannot be a doubt that,
  had he succeeded in his daring attempt, he would have been true
  to the letter of his word, and fulfilled a pledge which Britain
  never more required than at the period when that document was
  penned:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do not the pulpits and congregations of the clergy, as well
  as your weekly papers, ring with the dreadful threats of popery,
  slavery, tyranny, and arbitrary power, which are now ready to be
  imposed upon you by the formidable powers of France and Spain? Is
  not my royal father represented as a bloodthirsty tyrant,
  breathing out nothing but destruction to all who will not
  immediately embrace an odious religion? Or have I myself been
  better used? But listen only to the naked truth.</p>

  <p>"I, with my own money, hired a small vessel. Ill-supplied with
  money, arms, or friends, I arrived in Scotland, attended by seven
  persons. I publish the King my father's declaration, and proclaim
  his title, with pardon in one hand, and in the other liberty of
  conscience, and the most solemn promises to grant whatever a free
  Parliament shall propose for the happiness of a people. I have, I
  confess, the greatest reason to adore the goodness of Almighty
  God, who has in so remarkable a manner protected me and my small
  army through the many dangers to which we were at first exposed,
  and who has led me in the way to victory, and to the capital of
  this ancient kingdom, amidst the acclamations of the King my
  father's subjects. Why, then, is so much pains taken to spirit up
  the minds of the people against this my undertaking?</p>

  <p>"The reason is obvious; it is, lest the real sense of the
  nation's present sufferings should blot out the remembrance of
  past misfortunes, and of the outcries formerly raised against the
  royal family. Whatever miscarriages might have given occasion to
  them, they have been more than atoned for since; and the nation
  has now an opportunity of being secured against the like in
  future.</p>

  <p>"That our family has suffered exile during these fifty-seven
  years everybody knows. Has the nation, during that period of
  time, been the more happy and flourishing for it? Have you found
  reason to love and cherish your governors as the fathers of the
  people of Great Britain and Ireland? Has a family, upon whom a
  faction unlawfully bestowed the diadem of a rightful prince,
  retained a due sense of so great a trust and favour? Have you
  found more humanity and condescension in those who were not born
  to a crown, than in my royal forefathers? Have their ears been
  open to the cries of the people? Have they, or do they consider
  only the interests of these nations? Have you reaped any other
  benefit from them than an immense load of debt? If I am answered
  in the affirmative, why has their government been so often railed
  at in all your public assemblies? Why has the nation been so long
  crying out in vain for redress against the abuse of Parliaments,
  upon account of their long duration, the multitude of placemen,
  which occasions their venality, the introduction of penal laws,
  and, in general, against the miserable situation of the kingdom
  at home and abroad? All these, and many more inconveniences, must
  now be removed, unless the people of Great Britain be already so
  far corrupted that they will not accept of freedom when offered
  to them, seeing the King, on his restoration, will refuse nothing
  that a free Parliament can ask for the security of the religion,
  laws, and liberty of his people.</p>

  <p>"It is now time to conclude; and I shall do it with this
  reflection. Civil wars are ever attended with rancour and
  ill-will, which party rage never fails to produce in the minds of
  those whom different interests, principles or views, set in
  opposition to one another. I, therefore, earnestly require it of
  my friends to give as little loose as possible to such passions:
  this will prove the most effectual means to prevent the same in
  the enemies of my royal cause. And this my declaration will
  vindicate to all posterity the nobleness of my undertaking, and
  the generosity of my intentions."</p>

  <p>There was much truth in the open charges preferred in this
  declaration against the existing government. The sovereigns of
  the house of Hanover had always shown a marked predilection for
  their Continental possessions, and had proportionally neglected
  the affairs of Britain. Under Walpole's administration the
  imperial Parliament had degenerated from an independent assembly
  to a junta of placemen, and the most flagitious system of bribery
  was openly practised and avowed. It was not without reason that
  Charles contrasted the state of the nation then, with its
  position when under the rule of the legitimate family; and had
  there not been a strong, though, I think, unreasonable suspicion
  in the minds of many, that his success would be the prelude to a
  vigorous attack upon the established religions of the country,
  and that he would be inclined to follow out in this respect the
  fatal policy of his grandfather, Charles would in all probability
  have received a more active and general support than was accorded
  to him. The zeal with which the Episcopalian party in Scotland
  espoused his cause, naturally gave rise to the idea that the
  attempt of the Prince was of evil omen to Presbytery; and the
  settlement of the Church upon its present footing was yet so
  recent, that the sores of the old feud were still festering and
  green. The established clergy, therefore, were, nearly to a man,
  opposed to his pretensions; and one minister of Edinburgh, at the
  time when the Highland host was in possession of the city, had
  the courage to conclude his prayer nearly in the following
  terms&mdash;"Bless the king; Thou knows what king I
  mean&mdash;may his crown long sit easy on his head. And as to
  this young man who has come among us to seek an earthly crown, we
  beseech Thee in mercy to take him to Thyself, and give him a
  crown of glory!" At the same time, it is very curious to observe,
  that the most violent sect of Presbyterians, who might be
  considered as the representatives of the extreme Cameronian
  principle, and who had early seceded from the Church, and
  bitterly opposed the union of the kingdoms, were not indisposed,
  on certain terms, to coalesce with the Jacobites. It is hardly
  possible to understand the motives which actuated these men, who
  appear to have regarded each successive government as equally
  obnoxious. Some writers go the length of averring that, in 1688,
  a negociation was opened by one section of the Covenanters with
  Lord Dundee, with the object of resistance to the usurpation of
  William of Orange, and that the project was frustrated only by
  the death of that heroic nobleman. Sir Walter Scott&mdash;a great
  authority&mdash;seems to have been convinced that such was the
  case; but, in the absence of direct proof, I can hardly credit
  it. It is perfectly well known that a conspiracy was formed by a
  certain section of the Cameronian party to assassinate Lords
  Dundee and Dunfermline whilst in attendance at the meeting of
  Estates; and, although the recognition of William as king might
  not have been palatable to others who held the same opinions, it
  would be a strange thing if they had so suddenly resolved to
  assist Dundee in his efforts for the exiled family. But the
  political changes in Scotland, more especially the union, seem to
  have inspired some of these men with a spirit of disaffection to
  the government; for, according to Mr. Chambers, the most rigid
  sect of Presbyterians had, since the revolution, expressed a
  strong desire to coalesce with the Jacobites, with the hope, in
  case the house of Stuart were restored, to obtain what they
  called a covenanted king. Of this sect one thousand had assembled
  in Dumfriesshire at the first intelligence of the insurrection,
  bearing arms and colours, and supposed to contemplate a junction
  with the Chevalier. But these religionists were now almost as
  violently distinct from the Established Church of Scotland as
  ever they had been from those of England and Rome, and had long
  ceased to play a prominent part in the national disputes. The
  Established clergy, and the greater part of their congregations,
  were averse to Charles upon considerations perfectly moderate, at
  the same time not easy to be shaken.</p>

  <p>On commencing his march into England, Charles found himself at
  the head of an army of between five thousand and six thousand
  men, which force was considered strong enough, with the
  augmentations it might receive on the way, to effect the
  occupation of London. Had the English Jacobites performed their
  part with the same zeal as the Scots, it is more than probable
  that the attempt would have been crowned with success. As it was,
  the Prince succeeded in reducing the strong fortified town of
  Carlisle, and in marching, without opposition, through the heart
  of England, as far as Derby, within one hundred miles of the
  metropolis. But here his better genius deserted him. Discord had
  crept into his councils; for some of the chiefs became seriously
  alarmed at finding that the gentry of England were not prepared
  to join the expedition, but preferred remaining at home inactive
  spectators of the contest. Except at Manchester, they had
  received few or no recruits. No tidings had reached them from
  Wales, a country supposed to be devoted to the cause of King
  James, whilst it was well known that a large force was already in
  arms to oppose the clans. Mr. Chambers gives us the following
  details. "At a council of war held on the morning of the 5th
  December, Lord George Murray and the other members gave it as
  their unanimous opinion that the army ought to return to
  Scotland. Lord George pointed out that they were about to be
  environed by three armies, amounting collectively to about thirty
  thousand men, while their own forces were not above five
  thousand, if so many. Supposing an unsuccessful engagement with
  any of these armies, it could not be expected that one man would
  escape, for the militia would beset every road. The Prince, if
  not slain in the battle, must fall into the enemy's hands: the
  whole world would blame them as fools for running into such a
  risk. Charles answered, that he regarded not his own danger. He
  pressed, with all the force of argument, to go forward. He did
  not doubt, he said, that the justice of his cause would prevail.
  He was hopeful that there might be a defection in the enemy's
  army, and that many would declare for him. He was so very bent on
  putting all to the risk, that the Duke of Perth was for it, since
  his Royal Highness was. At last he proposed going to Wales
  instead of returning to Carlisle; but every other officer
  declared his opinion for a retreat. These are nearly the words of
  Lord George Murray. We are elsewhere told that the Prince
  condescended to use entreaties to induce his adherents to alter
  their resolution. 'Rather than go back,' he said, 'I would wish
  to be twenty feet under ground!' His chagrin, when he found his
  councillors obdurate, was beyond all bounds. The council broke
  up, on the understanding that the retreat was to commence next
  morning, Lord George volunteering to take the place of honour in
  the rear, provided only that he should not be troubled with the
  baggage."</p>

  <p>This resolution was received by the army with marks of
  unequivocal vexation. Retreat, in their estimation, was little
  less than overthrow; and it was most galling to find that, after
  all their labours, hazards, and toils, they were doomed to
  disappointment at the very moment when the prize seemed ready for
  their grasp. That the movement was an injudicious one is, I
  think, obvious. We are told, upon good authority, "that the very
  boldness of the Prince's onward movement, especially taken into
  connexion with the expected descent from France, had at length
  disposed the English Jacobites to come out; and many were just on
  the point of declaring themselves, and marching to join his army,
  when the retreat from Derby was determined on. A Mr. Barry
  arrived in Derby two days after the Prince left it, with a
  message from Sir Watkin William Wynne and Lord Barrymore, to
  assure him, in the names of many friends of the cause, that they
  were ready to join him in what manner he pleased, either in the
  capital, or every one to rise in his own county. I have likewise
  been assured that many of the Welsh gentry had actually left
  their homes, and were on the way to join Charles, when
  intelligence of his retreat at once sent them all back peaceably,
  convinced that it was now too late to contribute their
  assistance. These men, from the power they had over their
  tenantry, could have added materially to his military force. In
  fact, from all that appears, we must conclude that the insurgents
  had a very considerable chance of success from an onward
  movement&mdash;also, no doubt, a chance of destruction, and yet
  not worse than what ultimately befell many of them&mdash;while a
  retreat broke in a moment the spell which their gallantry had
  conjured up, and gave the enemy a great advantage over them."</p>

  <p>One victory more was accorded to Prince Charles, before his
  final overthrow. After successfully conducting his retreat to
  Scotland, occupying Glasgow, and strengthening his army by the
  accession of new recruits, he gave battle to the royal forces
  under General Hawley at Falkirk, and, as at Preston, drove them
  from the field. The parties were on this occasion fairly matched,
  there being about eight thousand men engaged on either side. The
  action was short; and, though not so decisive as the former one,
  gave great confidence to the insurgents. It has been thus
  picturesquely portrayed by the historian of the enterprise: "Some
  individuals, who beheld the battle from the steeple of Falkirk,
  used to describe these, its main events, as occupying a
  surprisingly brief space of time. They first saw the English army
  enter the misty and storm-covered muir at the top of the hill;
  then saw the dull atmosphere thickened by a fast-rolling smoke,
  and heard the pealing sounds of the discharge; immediately after,
  they beheld the discomfited troops burst wildly from the cloud in
  which they had been involved, and rush, in far-spread disorder,
  over the face of the hill. From the commencement of what they
  styled 'the break of the battle,' there did not intervene more
  than ten minutes&mdash;so soon may an efficient body of men
  become, by one transient emotion of cowardice, a feeble and
  contemptible rabble.</p>

  <p>"The rout would have been total, but for the three
  out-flanking regiments. These not having been opposed by any of
  the clans, having a ravine in front, and deriving some support
  from a small body of dragoons, stood their ground under the
  command of General Huske and Brigadier Cholmondley. When the
  Highlanders went past in pursuit, they received a volley from
  this part of the English army, which brought them to a pause, and
  caused them to draw back to their former ground, their impression
  being that some ambuscade was intended. This saved the English
  army from destruction. A pause took place, during which the bulk
  of the English infantry got back to Falkirk. It was not until
  Lord George Murray brought up the second line of his wing and the
  pickets, with some others on the other wing, that General Huske
  drew off his party, which he did in good order."</p>

  <p>The seat of war was now removed to the North. The month of
  April, 1746, found Prince Charles in possession of Inverness,
  with an army sorely dwindled in numbers, and in great want of
  necessaries and provisions. Many of the Highlanders had retired
  for the winter to their native glens, and had not yet rejoined
  the standard. The Duke of Cumberland, who now commanded the
  English army, with a reputation not diminished by the unfortunate
  issue of Fontenoy, was at the head of a large body of tried and
  disciplined troops, in the best condition, and supported by the
  powerful arm of artillery. He effected the passage of the Spey, a
  large and rapid river which intersects the Highlands, without
  encountering any opposition, and on the 15th of the month had
  arrived at Nairn, about nine miles distant from the position
  occupied by his kinsman and opponent. His superiority in point of
  strength was so great that the boldest of the insurgent chiefs
  hesitated as to the policy of giving immediate battle, and
  nothing but the desire of covering Inverness prevented the
  council from recommencing a further retreat into the mountains,
  where they could not have been easily followed, and where they
  were certain to have met with reinforcements. As to the Prince,
  his confidence in the prowess of the Highlanders was so
  unbounded, that, even with such odds against him, he would not
  listen to a proposal for delay.</p>

  <p>There yet remained, says Mr. Chambers, before playing the
  great stake of a pitched battle, one chance of success by the
  irregular mode of warfare to which the army was accustomed, and
  Charles resolved to put it to trial. This was a night-attack upon
  the camp of the Duke of Cumberland. He rightly argued that if his
  men could approach without being discovered, and make a
  simultaneous attack in more than one place, the royal forces,
  then probably either engaged in drinking their commander's health
  (the 15th happened to be the anniversary of the Duke's birthday,
  and was celebrated as such by his army), or sleeping off the
  effects of the debauch, must be completely surprised and cut to
  pieces, or at least effectually routed. The time appointed for
  setting out upon the march was eight in the evening, when
  daylight should have completely disappeared, and, in the mean
  time, great pains were taken to conceal the secret from the
  army.</p>

  <p>This resolution was entered into at three in the afternoon,
  and orders were given to collect the men who had gone off in
  search of provisions. The officers dispersed themselves to
  Inverness and other places, and besought the stragglers to repair
  to the muir. But, under the influence of hunger, they told their
  commanders to shoot them, if they pleased, rather than compel
  them to starve any longer. Charles had previously declared, with
  his characteristic fervour, that though only a thousand of his
  men should accompany him, he would lead them on to the attack,
  and he was not now intimidated when he saw twice that number
  ready to assist in the enterprise, though some of his officers
  would willingly have made this deficiency of troops an excuse for
  abandoning what they esteemed at best a hazardous expedition.
  Having given out for watchword the name of his father, he
  embraced Lord George Murray, who was to command the foremost
  column, and, putting himself at the head of that which followed,
  gave the order to march.</p>

  <p>The attempt proved peculiarly unfortunate, and, from the
  fatigue which it occasioned to the Highlanders, contributed in a
  great degree towards the disaster of the following day. The night
  chanced to be uncommonly dark, and as it was well known that
  Cumberland had stationed spies on the principal roads, it became
  necessary to select a devious route, in order to effect a
  surprise. The columns, proceeding over broken and irregular
  ground, soon became scattered and dislocated: no exertions of the
  officers could keep the men together, so that Lord George Murray
  at two o'clock found that he was still distant three miles from
  the hostile camp, and that there were no hopes of commencing the
  attack before the break of day, when they would be open to the
  observation of the enemy. Under these circumstances a retreat was
  commenced; and the scheme, which at one time seemed to hold out
  every probability of success, was abandoned.</p>

  <p>"The Highlanders returned, fatigued and disconsolate, to their
  former position, about seven in the morning, when they
  immediately addressed themselves to sleep, or went away in search
  of provisions. So scarce was food at this critical juncture, that
  the Prince himself, on retiring to Culloden House, could obtain
  no better refreshment than a little bread and whisky. He felt the
  utmost anxiety regarding his men, among whom the pangs of hunger,
  upon bodies exhausted by fatigue, must have been working effects
  most unpromising to his success; and he gave orders, before
  seeking any repose, that the whole country should now be
  mercilessly ransacked for the means of refreshment. His orders
  were not without effect. Considerable supplies were procured, and
  subjected to the cook's art at Inverness; but the poor famished
  clansmen were destined never to taste these provisions, the hour
  of battle arriving before they were prepared."</p>

  <p>About eleven in the forenoon, the troops of Cumberland were
  observed upon the eastern extremity of the wide muir of Culloden,
  and preparations were instantly made for the coming battle. The
  army had been strengthened that morning by the arrival of the
  Keppoch Macdonalds and a party of the Frasers; but even with
  these reinforcements the whole available force which the Prince
  could muster was about five thousand men, to oppose at fearful
  odds an enemy twice as numerous, and heavily supported by
  artillery. Fortune on this day seemed to have deserted the Prince
  altogether. In drawing out the line of battle, a most unlucky
  arrangement was made by O'Sullivan, who acted as adjutant,
  whereby the Macdonald regiments were removed from the right
  wing&mdash;the place which the great clan Colla has been
  privileged to hold in Scottish array ever since the auspicious
  battle of Bannockburn. To those who are not acquainted with the
  peculiar temper and spirit of the Highlanders, and their
  punctilio upon points of honour and precedence, the question of
  arrangement will naturally appear a matter of little importance.
  But it was not so felt by the Macdonalds, who considered their
  change of position as a positive degradation, and who further
  looked upon it as an evil omen to the success of the battle. The
  results of this mistake will be explained immediately.</p>

  <p>Just before the commencement of the action, the weather, which
  had hitherto been fair and sunny, became overcast, and a heavy
  blast of rain and sleet beat directly in the faces of the
  Highlanders. The English artillery then began to play upon them,
  and, being admirably served, every discharge told with fearful
  effect upon the ranks. The chief object of either party at the
  battle of Culloden seems to have been to force its opponent to
  leave his position, and to commence the attack. Cumberland,
  finding that his artillery was doing such execution, had no
  occasion to move; and Charles appears to have committed a great
  error in abandoning a mode of warfare which was peculiarly suited
  for his troops, and which, on two previous occasions, had proved
  eminently successful. Had he at once ordered a general charge,
  and attempted to silence the guns, the issue of the day might
  have been otherwise: but his unfortunate star prevailed.</p>

  <p>"It was not," says Mr. Chambers, "till the cannonade had
  continued nearly half an hour, and the Highlanders had seen many
  of their kindred stretched upon the heath, that Charles at last
  gave way to the necessity of ordering a charge. The aide-de-camp
  intrusted to carry his message to the Lieutenant-general&mdash;a
  youth of the name of Maclachlan&mdash;was killed by a cannon-ball
  before he reached the first line, but the general sentiment of
  the army, as reported to Lord George Murray, supplied the want,
  and that general took it upon him to order an attack without
  Charles's permission having been communicated.</p>

  <p>"Lord George had scarcely determined upon ordering a general
  movement, when the Macintoshes, a brave and devoted clan, though
  not before engaged in action, unable any longer to brook the
  unavenged slaughter made by the cannon, broke from the centre of
  the line, and rushed forward through smoke and snow to mingle
  with the enemy. The Athole men, Camerons, Stuarts, Frasers, and
  Macleans also went on, Lord George Murray heading them with that
  rash bravery befitting the commander of such forces. Thus, in the
  course of one or two minutes, the charge was general along the
  whole line, except at the left extremity, where the Macdonalds,
  dissatisfied with their position, hesitated to engage.</p>

  <p>"The action and event of the onset were, throughout, quite as
  dreadful as the mental emotion which urged it. Notwithstanding
  that the three files of the front line of English poured forth
  their incessant fire of musketry&mdash;notwithstanding that the
  cannon, now loaded with grapeshot, swept the field as with a
  hailstorm&mdash;notwithstanding the flank fire of Wolfe's
  regiment&mdash;onward, onward went the headlong Highlanders,
  flinging themselves into, rather than rushing upon, the lines of
  the enemy, which, indeed, they did not see for smoke, till
  involved among the weapons. All that courage, all that despair
  could do, was done. It was a moment of dreadful and agonising
  suspense, but only a moment&mdash;for the whirlwind does not reap
  the forest with greater rapidity than the Highlanders cleared the
  line. Nevertheless, almost every man in their front rank, chief
  and gentleman, fell before the deadly weapons which they had
  braved; and, although the enemy gave way, it was not till every
  bayonet was bent and bloody with the strife.</p>

  <p>"When the first line had thus been swept aside, the assailants
  continued their impetuous advance till they came near the second,
  when, being almost annihilated by a profuse and well-directed
  fire, the shattered remains of what had been before a numerous
  and confident force began to give way. Still a few rushed on,
  resolved rather to die than forfeit their well-acquired and
  dearly-estimated honour. They rushed on; but not a man ever came
  in contact with the enemy. The last survivor perished as he
  reached the points of the bayonets."</p>

  <p>Some idea of the determination displayed by the Highlanders in
  this terrific charge may be gathered from the fact that, in one
  part of the field, their bodies were afterwards found in layers
  of three and four deep. The slaughter was fearful, for, out of
  the five regiments which charged the English, almost all the
  leaders and men in the front rank were killed. So shaken was the
  English line, that, had the Macdonald regiments, well-known to
  yield in valour to none of the clans, come up, the fortune of the
  day might have been altered. But they never made an onset.
  Smarting and sullen at the affront which they conceived to have
  been put upon their name, they bore the fire of the English
  regiments without flinching, and gave way to their rage by hewing
  at the heather with their swords. In vain their chiefs exhorted
  them to go forward: even at that terrible moment the pride of
  clanship prevailed. "My God!" cried Macdonald of Keppoch, "has it
  come to this, that the children of my tribe have forsaken me!"
  and he rushed forward alone, sword in hand, with the devotion of
  an ancient hero, and fell pierced with bullets.</p>

  <p>The Lowland and foreign troops which formed the second line
  were powerless to retrieve the disaster. All was over. The rout
  became general, and the Prince was forced from the field, which
  he would not quit, until dragged from it by his immediate
  bodyguard.</p>

  <p>Such was the last battle, the result of civil war, which has
  been fought on British soil. Those who were defeated have
  acquired as much glory from it as the conquerors&mdash;and even
  more, for never was a conquest sullied by such deeds of
  deliberate cruelty as were perpetrated upon the survivors of the
  battle of Culloden. It is not, however, the object of the present
  paper to recount these, or even the romantic history or
  hairbreadth escapes of the Prince, whilst wandering on the
  mainland and through the Hebrides. Although a reward of thirty
  thousand pounds&mdash;an immense sum for the period&mdash;was set
  upon his head&mdash;although his secret was known to hundreds of
  persons in every walk of life, and even to the beggar and the
  outlaw&mdash;not one attempted to betray him. Not one of all his
  followers, in the midst of the misery which overtook them,
  regretted having drawn the sword in his cause, or would not again
  have gladly imperilled their lives for the sake of their beloved
  Chevalier. "He went," says Lord Mahon, "but not with him departed
  his remembrance from the Highlanders. For years and years did his
  name continue enshrined in their hearts and familiar to their
  tongues, their plaintive ditties resounding with his exploits and
  inviting his return. Again, in these strains, do they declare
  themselves ready to risk life and fortune for his cause; and even
  maternal fondness&mdash;the strongest, perhaps, of all human
  feelings&mdash;yields to the passionate devotion to Prince
  Charlie."</p>

  <p>The subsequent life of the Prince is a story of melancholy
  interest. We find him at first received in France with all the
  honours due to one who, though unfortunate, had exhibited a
  heroism rarely equalled and never surpassed: gradually he was
  neglected and slighted, as one of a doomed and unhappy race, whom
  no human exertion could avail to elevate to their former seat of
  power; and finally, when his presence in France became an
  obstacle to the conclusion of peace, he was violently arrested
  and conveyed out of the kingdom. There can be little doubt that
  continued misfortune and disappointment had begun very early to
  impair his noble mind. For long periods he was a wanderer, lost
  sight of by his friends and even by his father and brother. There
  are fragments of his writing extant which show how poignantly he
  felt the cruelty of his fortune. "De vivre et pas vivre est
  beaucoup plus que de mourir!" And again, writing to his father's
  secretary, eight years after Culloden, he says&mdash;"I am
  grieved that our master should think that my silence was either
  neglect or want of duty; but, in reality, my situation is such
  that I have nothing to say but imprecations against the fatality
  of being born in such a detestable age." An unhappy and
  uncongenial marriage tended still more to embitter his existence;
  and if at last he yielded to frailties, which inevitably insure
  degradation, it must be remembered that his lot had been one to
  which few men have ever been exposed, and the magnitude of his
  sufferings may fairly be admitted as some palliation for his
  weakness.</p>

  <p>To the last, his heart was with Scotland. The following
  anecdote was related by his brother, Cardinal York, to Bishop
  Walker, the late Primus of the Episcopal Church of
  Scotland:&mdash;"Mr. Greathead, a personal friend of Mr. Fox,
  succeeded, when at Rome in 1782 or 1783, in obtaining an
  interview with Charles Edward; and, being alone with him for some
  time, studiously led the conversation to his enterprise in
  Scotland, and to the occurrences which succeeded the failure of
  that attempt. The Prince manifested some reluctance to enter upon
  these topics, appearing at the same time to undergo so much
  mental suffering, that his guest regretted the freedom he had
  used in calling up the remembrance of his misfortunes. At length,
  however, the Prince seemed to shake off the load which oppressed
  him; his eye brightened, his face assumed unwonted animation, and
  he entered upon the narrative of his Scottish campaigns with a
  distinct but somewhat vehement energy of manner&mdash;recounted
  his marches, his battles, his victories, his retreats, and his
  defeats&mdash;detailed his hairbreadth escapes in the Western
  Isles, the inviolable and devoted attachment of his Highland
  friends, and at length proceeded to allude to the terrible
  penalties with which the chiefs among them had been visited. But
  here the tide of emotion rose too high to allow him to go
  on&mdash;his voice faltered, his eyes became fixed, and he fell
  convulsed on the floor. The noise brought into his room his
  daughter, the Duchess of Albany, who happened to be in an
  adjoining apartment. 'Sir,' she exclaimed, 'what is this? You
  have been speaking to my father about Scotland and the
  Highlanders! No one dares to mention those subjects in his
  presence.'"</p>

  <p>He died on the 30th of January, 1788, in the arms of the
  Master of Nairn. The monument erected to him, his father, and
  brother, in St. Peter's, by desire of George IV., was perhaps the
  most graceful tribute ever paid by royalty to
  misfortune&mdash;REGIO CINERI PIETAS REGIA.</p>

    <p>Worthy matter for a minstrel</p>

    <p class="i2">To be told in knightly song!</p>

    <p>Worthy of a bold Proven&ccedil;al,</p>

    <p class="i2">Pacing through the peaceful plain,</p>

    <p>Singing of his lady's favour,</p>

    <p class="i2">Boasting of her silken chain,</p>

  <h2>NOTES TO "CHARLES EDWARD AT VERSAILLES"</h2>
  <pre>
  <i>Could I change this gilded bondage
       Even for the dusky tower
     Whence King James beheld his lady
       Sitting in the castle bower</i>.&mdash;<a href=
"#p168">(above)</a>.
</pre>

  <p>James I. of Scotland, one of the most accomplished kings that
  ever sate upon a throne, is the person here indicated. His
  history is a very strange and romantic one. He was son of Robert
  III., and immediate younger brother of that unhappy Duke of
  Rothesay who was murdered at Falkland. His father, apprehensive
  of the designs and treachery of Albany, had determined to remove
  him, when a mere boy, for a season from Scotland; and as France
  was then considered the best school for the education of one so
  important from his high position, it was resolved to send him
  thither, under the care of the Earl of Orkney, and Fleming of
  Cumbernauld. He accordingly embarked at North Berwick, with
  little escort&mdash;as there was a truce for the time between
  England and Scotland; and they were under no apprehension of
  meeting with any vessels, save those of the former nation.
  Notwithstanding this, the ship which carried the Prince was
  captured by an armed merchantman, and carried to London, where
  Henry IV., the usurping Bolingbroke, utterly regardless of
  treaties, committed him and his attendants to the Tower.</p>

  <p>"In vain," says Mr. Tytler, "did the guardians of the young
  Prince remonstrate against this cruelty, or present to Henry a
  letter from the King his father, which, with much simplicity,
  recommended him to the kindness of the English monarch, should he
  find it necessary to land in his dominions. In vain did they
  represent that the mission to France was perfectly pacific, and
  its only object the education of the prince at the French court.
  Henry merely answered by a poor witticism, declaring that he
  himself knew the French language indifferently well, and that his
  father could not have sent him to a better master. So flagrant a
  breach of the law of nations, as the seizure and imprisonment of
  the heir-apparent, during the time of truce, would have called
  for the most violent remonstrances from any government, except
  that of Albany. But to this usurper of the supreme power, the
  capture of the Prince was the most grateful event which could
  have happened; and to detain him in captivity became, from this
  moment, one of the principal objects of his future life; we are
  not to wonder, then, that the conduct of Henry not only drew
  forth no indignation from the governor, but was not even followed
  by any request that the prince should be set at liberty.</p>

  <p>"The aged King, already worn out by infirmity, and now broken
  by disappointment and sorrow, did not long survive the captivity
  of his son. It is said the melancholy news were brought him as he
  was sitting down to supper in his palace of Rothesay in Bute, and
  that the effect was such upon his affectionate but feeble spirit,
  that he drooped from that day forward, refused all sustenance,
  and died soon after of a broken heart."</p>

  <p>James was finally incarcerated in Windsor Castle, where he
  endured an imprisonment of nineteen years. Henry, though he had
  not hesitated to commit a heinous breach of faith, was not so
  cruel as to neglect the education of his captive. The young King
  was supplied with the best masters; and gradually became an adept
  in all the accomplishments of the age. He is a singular exception
  from the rule which maintains that monarchs are indifferent
  authors. As a poet, he is entitled to a very high rank indeed,
  being, I think, in point of sweetness and melody of verse, not
  much inferior to Chaucer. From the window of his chamber in the
  Tower, he had often seen a young lady, of great beauty and grace,
  walking in the garden; and the admiration which at once possessed
  him soon ripened into love. This was Lady Jane Beaufort, daughter
  of the Earl of Somerset and niece of Henry IV., and who
  afterwards became his queen. How he loved and how he wooed her is
  told in his own beautiful poem of "The King's Quhair," of which
  the following are a few stanzas:&mdash;</p>
  <pre>
  "Now there was made, fast by the towris wall,
  A garden fair; and in the corners set
  An arbour green, with wandis long and small
  Railed about, and so with trees set
  Was all the place, and hawthorn hedges knet,
  That lyf was none walking there forbye,
  That might within scarce any wight espy.

  "So thick the boughis and the leavis greene
  Beshaded all the alleys that there were,
  And mids of every arbour might be seen
  The sharpe, greene, sweete juniper,
  Growing so fair, with branches here and there,
  That, as it seemed to a lyf without,
  The boughis spread the arbour all about.

  "And on the smalle greene twistis sat
  The little sweet nightingale, and sung
  So loud and clear the hymnis consecrat
  Of lovis use, now soft, now loud among,
  That all the gardens and the wallis rung
  Right of their song.

  "And therewith cast I down mine eyes again,
  Where as I saw, walking under the tower,
  Full secretly, now comen here to plain,
  The fairest or the freshest younge flower
  That e'er I saw, methought, before that hour:
  For which sudden abate, anon astart
  The blood of all my body to my heart.

  "And though I stood abasit for a lite,
  No wonder was; for why? my wittis all
  Were so o'ercome with pleasance and delight&mdash;
  Only through letting of my eyen fall&mdash;
  That suddenly my heart became her thrall
  For ever of free will, for of menace
  There was no token in her sweete face."




  <i>Wherefore, Love, didst thou betray me?
       Where is now the tender glance?
     Where the meaning looks once lavished
       By the dark-eyed Maid of France?</i>&mdash;<a href=
"#p168-2">(above)</a>.
</pre>

  <p>There appears to be no doubt that Prince Charles was deeply
  attached to one of the princesses of the royal family of France.
  In the interesting collection called "Jacobite Memoirs," compiled
  by Mr. Chambers from the voluminous MSS. of Bishop Forbes, we
  find the following passage from the narrative of Donald Macleod,
  who acted as a guide to the wanderer whilst traversing the
  Hebrides:&mdash;"When Donald was asked, if ever the Prince used
  to give any particular toast, when they were taking a cup of cold
  water, or the like; he said that the Prince very often drank to
  the Black Eye&mdash;by which, said Donald, he meant the second
  daughter of France, and I never heard him name any particular
  health but that alone. When he spoke of that lady&mdash;which he
  did frequently&mdash;he appeared to be more than ordinarily well
  pleased."</p>

  <h2>THE OLD SCOTTISH CAVALIER</h2>

  <p>The "gentle Locheill" may he considered as the pattern of a
  Highland Chief. Others who headed the insurrection may have been
  actuated by motives of personal ambition, and by a desire for
  aggrandisement; but no such charge can be made against the
  generous and devoted Cameron. He was, as we have already seen,
  the first who attempted to dissuade the Prince from embarking in
  an enterprise which he conscientiously believed to be desperate;
  but, having failed in doing so, he nobly stood firm to the cause
  which his conscience vindicated as just, and cheerfully
  imperilled his life, and sacrificed his fortune, at the bidding
  of his master. There was no one, even among those who espoused
  the other side, in Scotland, who did not commiserate the
  misfortunes of this truly excellent man, whose humanity was not
  less conspicuous than his valour throughout the civil war, and
  who died in exile of a broken heart.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the best type of the Lowland Cavalier of that period,
  may be found in the person of Alexander Forbes, Lord Pitsligo, a
  nobleman whose conscientious views impelled him to take a
  different side from that adopted by the greater part of his house
  and name. Lord Forbes, the head of this very ancient and
  honourable family, was one of the first Scottish noblemen who
  declared for King William. Lord Pitsligo, on the contrary, having
  been educated abroad, and early introduced to the circle at Saint
  Germains, conceived a deep personal attachment to the members of
  the exiled line. He was anything but an enthusiast, as his
  philosophical and religious writings, well worthy of a perusal,
  will show. He was the intimate friend of F&eacute;n&eacute;lon,
  and throughout his whole life was remarkable rather for his piety
  and virtue, than for keenness in political dispute.</p>

  <p>After his return from France, Lord Pitsligo took his seat in
  the Scottish Parliament, and his parliamentary career has thus
  been characterised by a former writer.[<a href="#note-3">3</a>]
  "Here it is no discredit either to his head or heart to say,
  that, obliged to become a member of one of the contending
  factions of the time, he adopted that which had for its object
  the independence of Scotland, and restoration of the ancient race
  of monarchs. The advantages which were in future to arise from
  the great measure of a national union were so hidden by the mist
  of prejudice, that it cannot be wondered at if Lord Pitsligo,
  like many a high-spirited man, saw nothing but disgrace in a
  measure forced on by such corrupt means, and calling in its
  commencement for such mortifying national sacrifices. The English
  nation, indeed, with a narrow, yet not unnatural, view of their
  own interest, took such pains to encumber and restrict the
  Scottish commercial privileges that it was not till the best part
  of a century after the event that the inestimable fruits of the
  treaty began to be felt and known. This distant period Lord
  Pitsligo could not foresee. He beheld his countrymen, like the
  Israelites of yore, led into the desert; but his merely human eye
  could not foresee that, after the extinction of a whole
  race&mdash;after a longer pilgrimage than that of the followers
  of Moses&mdash;the Scottish people should at length arrive at
  that promised land, of which the favourers of the Union held
  forth so gay a prospect.</p>

  <p>"Looking upon the Act of Settlement of the Crown, and the Act
  of Abjuration, as unlawful, Lord Pitsligo retired to his house in
  the country, and threw up attendance on Parliament. Upon the
  death of Queen Anne he joined himself in arms with a general
  insurrection of the Highlanders and Jacobites, headed by his
  friend and relative the Earl of Mar.</p>

  <p>"Mar, a versatile statesman and an able intriguer, had
  consulted his ambition rather than his talents when he assumed
  the command of such an enterprise. He sunk beneath the far
  superior genius of the Duke of Argyle; and after the undecisive
  battle of Sheriffmuir, the confederacy which he had formed, but
  was unable to direct, dissolved like a snow-ball, and the nobles
  concerned in it were fain to fly abroad. This exile was Lord
  Pitsligo's fate for five or six years. Part of the time he spent
  at the Court, if it can be called so, of the old Chevalier de
  Saint George, where existed all the petty feuds, chicanery, and
  crooked intrigues which subsist in a real scene of the same
  character, although the objects of the ambition which prompts
  such arts had no existence. Men seemed to play at being courtiers
  in that illusory court, as children play at being soldiers."</p>

  <p>It would appear that Lord Pitsligo was not attainted for his
  share in Mar's rebellion. He returned to Scotland in 1720, and
  resided at his castle in Aberdeenshire, not mingling in public
  affairs, but gaining, through his charity, kindness, and
  benevolence, the respect and affection of all around him. He was
  sixty-seven years of age when Charles Edward landed in Scotland.
  The district in which the estates of Lord Pitsligo lay was
  essentially Jacobite, and the young cavaliers only waited for a
  fitting leader to take up arms in the cause. According to Mr.
  Home, his example was decisive of the movement of his neighbours:
  "So when he who was so wise and prudent declared his purpose of
  joining Charles, most of the gentlemen in that part of the
  country who favoured the Pretender's cause, put themselves under
  his command, thinking they could not follow a better or safer
  guide than Lord Pitsligo." His Lordship's own account of the
  motives which urged him on is peculiar:&mdash;"I was grown a
  little old, and the fear of ridicule stuck to me pretty much. I
  have mentioned the weightier considerations of a family, which
  would make the censure still the greater, and set the more
  tongues agoing. But we are pushed on, I know not how,&mdash;I
  thought&mdash;I weighed&mdash;and I weighed again. If there was
  any enthusiasm in it, it was of the coldest kind; and there was
  as little remorse when the affair miscarried, as there was
  eagerness at the beginning."</p>

  <p>The writer whom I have already quoted goes on to say&mdash;"To
  those friends who recalled his misfortunes of 1715, he replied
  gaily, 'Did you ever know me absent at the second day of a
  wedding?' meaning, I suppose, that having once contracted an
  engagement, he did not feel entitled to quit it while the contest
  subsisted. Being invited by the gentlemen of the district to put
  himself at their head, and having surmounted his own desires, he
  had made a farewell visit at a neighbour's house, where a little
  boy, a child of the family, brought out a stool to assist the old
  nobleman in remounting his horse. 'My little fellow.' said Lord
  Pitsligo, 'this is the severest rebuke I have yet received, for
  presuming to go on such an expedition.'</p>

  <p>"The die was however cast, and Lord Pitsligo went to meet his
  friends at the rendezvous they had appointed in Aberdeen. They
  formed a body of well-armed cavalry, gentlemen and their
  servants, to the number of a hundred men. When they were drawn up
  in readiness to commence the expedition, the venerable nobleman,
  their leader, moved to their front, lifted his hat, and, looking
  up to heaven, pronounced, with a solemn voice, the awful
  appeal,&mdash;'O Lord, thou knowest that our cause is just!' then
  added the signal for departure&mdash;'March, gentlemen!'</p>

  <p>"Lord Pitsligo, with his followers, found Charles at
  Edinburgh, on 8th October 1745, a few days after the Highlanders'
  victory at Preston. Their arrival was hailed with enthusiasm, not
  only on account of the timely reinforcement, but more especially
  from the high character of their leader. Hamilton of Bangour, in
  an animated and eloquent eulogium upon Pitsligo, states that
  nothing could have fallen out more fortunately for the Prince
  than his joining them did&mdash;for it seemed as if religion,
  virtue, and justice were entering his camp, under the appearance
  of this venerable old man; and what would have given sanction to
  a cause of the most dubious right, could not fail to render
  sacred the very best."</p>

  <p>Although so far advanced in years, he remained in arms during
  the whole campaign, and was treated with almost filial tenderness
  by the Prince. After Culloden, he became, like many more, a
  fugitive and an outlaw, but succeeded, like the Baron of
  Bradwardine, in finding a shelter upon the skirts of his own
  estate. Disguised as a mendicant, his secret was faithfully kept
  by the tenantry; and although it was more than surmised by the
  soldiers that he was lurking somewhere in the neighbourhood, they
  never were able to detect him. On one occasion he actually guided
  a party to a cave on the sea-shore, amidst the rough rocks of
  Buchan, where it was rumoured that he was lying in concealment;
  and on another, when overtaken by his asthma, and utterly unable
  to escape from an approaching patrol of soldiers, he sat down by
  the wayside, and acted his assumed character so well, that a
  good-natured fellow not only gave him alms, but condoled with him
  on the violence of his complaint.</p>

  <p>For ten years he remained concealed, but in the mean time both
  title and estate were forfeited by attainder. His last escape was
  so very remarkable, that I may be pardoned for giving it in the
  language of the author of his memoirs.</p>

  <p>"In March 1756, and of course long after all apprehension of a
  search had ceased, information having been given to the
  commanding officer at Fraserburgh, that Lord Pitsligo was at that
  moment at the house of Auchiries, it was acted upon with so much
  promptness and secrecy that the search must have proved
  successful but for a very singular occurrence. Mrs. Sophia
  Donaldson, a lady who lived much with the family, repeatedly
  dreamt, on that particular night, that the house was surrounded
  by soldiers. Her mind became so haunted with the idea, that she
  got out of bed, and was walking through the room, in hopes of
  giving a different current to her thoughts before she lay down
  again; when, day beginning to dawn, she accidentally looked out
  at the window as she passed it in traversing the room, and was
  astonished at actually observing the figures of soldiers among
  some trees near the house. So completely had all idea of a search
  been by that time laid asleep, that she supposed they had come to
  steal poultry&mdash;Jacobite poultry-yards affording a safe
  object of pillage for the English soldiers in those days. Mrs.
  Sophia was proceeding to rouse the servants, when her sister,
  having awaked, and inquiring what was the matter, and being told
  of soldiers near the house, exclaimed in great alarm, that she
  feared they wanted something more than hens. She begged Mrs.
  Sophia to look out at a window on the other side of the house,
  when not only were soldiers seen in that direction, but also an
  officer giving instructions by signal, and frequently putting his
  fingers to his lips, as if enjoining silence.</p>

  <p>There was now no time to be lost in rousing the family, and
  all the haste that could be made was scarcely sufficient to hurry
  the venerable man from his bed into a small recess, behind the
  wainscot of an adjoining room, which was concealed by a bed, in
  which a lady, Miss Gordon of Towie, who was there on a visit,
  lay, before the soldiers obtained admission. A most minute search
  took place. The room in which Lord Pitsligo was concealed did not
  escape. Miss Gordon's bed was carefully examined, and she was
  obliged to suffer the rude scrutiny of one of the party, by
  feeling her chin, to ascertain that it was not a man in a lady's
  night-dress. Before the soldiers had finished their examination
  in this room, the confinement and anxiety increased Lord
  Pitsligo's asthma so much, and his breathing became so loud, that
  it cost Miss Gordon, lying in bed, much and violent coughing,
  which she counterfeited, in order to prevent the high breathings
  behind the wainscot from being heard.</p>

  <p>It may be easily conceived what agony she would suffer, lest,
  by overdoing her part, she should increase suspicion, and in fact
  lead to a discovery. The ruse was fortunately successful. On the
  search through the house being given over, Lord Pitsligo was
  hastily taken from his confined situation, and again replaced in
  bed; and, as soon as he was able to speak, his accustomed
  kindness of heart made him say to his servant&mdash;'James, go
  and see that these poor fellows get some breakfast and a drink of
  warm ale, for this is a cold morning; they are only doing their
  duty, and cannot bear me any ill-will.' When the family were
  felicitating each other on his escape, he pleasantly
  observed&mdash;'A poor prize, had they obtained it&mdash;an old
  dying man!'"</p>

  <p>This was the last attempt made on the part of government to
  seize on the persons of any of the surviving insurgents. Three
  years before, Dr. Archibald Cameron, a brother of Locheill,
  having clandestinely revisited Scotland, was arrested, tried, and
  executed for high treason at Tyburn. The government was generally
  blamed for this act of severity, which was considered rather to
  have been dictated by revenge than required for the public
  safety. It is, however, probable that they might have had secret
  information of certain negotiations which were still conducted in
  the Highlands by the agents of the Stuart family, and that they
  considered it necessary, by one terrible example, to overawe the
  insurrectionary spirit. This I believe to have been the real
  motive of an execution which otherwise could not have been
  palliated: and, in the case of Lord Pitsligo, it is quite
  possible that the zeal of a partisan may have led him to take a
  step which would not have been approved of by the ministry. After
  the lapse of so many years, and after so many scenes of judicial
  bloodshed, the nation would have turned in disgust from the
  spectacle of an old man, whose private life was not only
  blameless, but exemplary, dragged to the scaffold, and forced to
  lay down his head in expiation of a doubtful crime: and this view
  derives corroboration from the fact that, shortly afterwards,
  Lord Pitsligo was tacitly permitted to return to the society of
  his friends, without further notice or persecution.</p>

  <p>Dr. King, the Principal of St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, has borne
  the following testimony to the character of Lord Pitsligo.
  "Whoever is so happy, either from his natural disposition, or his
  good judgment, constantly to observe St. Paul's precept, 'to
  speak evil of no one' will certainly acquire the love and esteem
  of the whole community of which he is a member. But such a man is
  the <i>rara avis in terris</i>; and, among all my acquaintance, I
  have known only one person to whom I can with truth assign this
  character. The person I mean is the present Lord Pitsligo of
  Scotland. I not only never heard this gentleman speak an ill word
  of any man living, but I always observed him ready to defend any
  other person who was ill spoken of in his company. If the person
  accused were of his acquaintance, my Lord Pitsligo would always
  find something good to say of him as a counterpoise. If he were a
  stranger, and quite unknown to him, my lord would urge in his
  defence the general corruption of manners, and the frailties and
  infirmities of human nature.</p>

  <p>"It is no wonder that such an excellent man, who, besides, is
  a polite scholar, and has many other great and good qualities,
  should be universally admired and beloved&mdash;insomuch, that I
  persuade myself he has not one enemy in the world. At least, to
  this general esteem and affection for his person, his
  preservation must be owing; for since his attainder he has never
  removed far from his own house, protected by men of different
  principles, and unsought for and unmolested by government." To
  which eulogy it might be added, by those who have the good
  fortune to know his representatives, that the virtues here
  acknowledged seem hereditary in the family of Pitsligo.</p>

  <p>The venerable old nobleman was permitted to remain without
  molestation at the residence of his son, during the latter years
  of an existence protracted to the extreme verge of human life.
  And so, says the author of his memoirs, "In this happy frame of
  mind,&mdash;calm and full of hope,&mdash;the saintly man
  continued to the last, with his reason unclouded, able to study
  his favourite volume, enjoying the comforts of friendship, and
  delighting in the consolations of religion, till he gently 'fell
  asleep in Jesus.' He died on the 21st of December, 1762, in the
  eighty-fifth year of his age; and to his surviving friends the
  recollection of the misfortunes which had accompanied him through
  his long life was painfully awakened even in the closing scene of
  his mortal career&mdash;as his son had the mortification to be
  indebted to a stranger, now the proprietor of his ancient
  inheritance by purchase from the crown, for permission to lay his
  father's honoured remains in the vault which contained the ashes
  of his family for many generations."</p>

  <p>Such a character as this is well worthy of remembrance; and
  Lord Pitsligo has just title to be called the last of the old
  Scottish Cavaliers. I trust that, in adapting the words of the
  following little ballad to a well-known English air, I have
  committed no unpardonable larceny.</p>

  <h2>BLIND OLD MILTON</h2>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Place me once more, my daughter, where the sun</p>

      <p>May shine upon my old and time-worn head,</p>

      <p>For the last time, perchance. My race is run;</p>

      <p>And soon amidst the ever-silent dead</p>

      <p>I must repose, it may be, half forgot.</p>

      <p>Yes! I have broke the hard and bitter bread</p>

      <p>For many a year, with those who trembled not</p>

      <p>To buckle on their armour for the fight,</p>

      <p>And set themselves against the tyrant's lot;</p>

      <p>And I have never bowed me to his might,</p>

      <p>Nor knelt before him&mdash;for I bear within</p>

      <p>My heart the sternest consciousness of right,</p>

      <p>And that perpetual hate of gilded sin</p>

      <p>Which made me what I am; and though the stain</p>

      <p>Of poverty be on me, yet I win</p>

      <p>More honour by it, than the blinded train</p>

      <p>Who hug their willing servitude, and bow</p>

      <p>Unto the weakest and the most profane.</p>

      <p>Therefore, with unencumbered soul I go</p>

      <p>Before the footstool of my Maker, where</p>

      <p>I hope to stand as undebased as now!</p>

      <p>Child! is the sun abroad? I feel my hair</p>

      <p>Borne up and wafted by the gentle wind,</p>

      <p>I feel the odours that perfume the air,</p>

      <p>And hear the rustling of the leaves behind.</p>

      <p>Within my heart I picture them, and then</p>

      <p>I almost can forget that I am blind,</p>

      <p>And old, and hated by my fellow-men.</p>

      <p>Yet would I fain once more behold the grace</p>

      <p>Of nature ere I die, and gaze again</p>

      <p>Upon her living and rejoicing face&mdash;</p>

      <p>Fain would I see thy countenance, my child,</p>

      <p>My comforter! I feel thy dear embrace&mdash;</p>

      <p>I hear thy voice, so musical, and mild,</p>

      <p>The patient, sole interpreter, by whom</p>

      <p>So many years of sadness are beguiled;</p>

      <p>For it hath made my small and scanty room</p>

      <p>Peopled with glowing visions of the past.</p>

      <p>But I will calmly bend me to my doom,</p>

      <p>And wait the hour which is approaching fast,</p>

      <p>When triple light shall stream upon mine eyes,</p>

      <p>And heaven itself be opened up at last</p>

      <p>To him who dared foretell its mysteries.</p>

      <p>I have had visions in this drear eclipse</p>

      <p>Of outward consciousness, and clomb the skies,</p>

      <p>Striving to utter with my earthly lips</p>

      <p>What the diviner soul had half divined,</p>

      <p>Even as the Saint in his Apocalypse</p>

      <p>Who saw the inmost glory, where enshrined</p>

      <p>Sat He who fashioned glory. This hath driven</p>

      <p>All outward strife and tumult from my mind,</p>

      <p>And humbled me, until I have forgiven</p>

      <p>My bitter enemies, and only seek</p>

      <p>To find the straight and narrow path to heaven.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Yet I am weak&mdash;oh! how entirely weak,</p>

      <p>For one who may not love nor suffer more!</p>

      <p>Sometimes unbidden tears will wet my cheek,</p>

      <p>And my heart bound as keenly as of yore,</p>

      <p>Responsive to a voice, now hushed to rest,</p>

      <p>Which made the beautiful Italian shore,</p>

      <p>In all its pomp of summer vineyards drest,</p>

      <p>An Eden and a Paradise to me.</p>

      <p>Do the sweet breezes from the balmy west</p>

      <p>Still murmur through thy groves, Parthenope,</p>

      <p>In search of odours from the orange bowers?</p>

      <p>Still on thy slopes of verdure does the bee</p>

      <p>Cull her rare honey from the virgin flowers?</p>

      <p>And Philomel her plaintive chaunt prolong</p>

      <p>'Neath skies more calm and more serene than ours,</p>

      <p>Making the summer one perpetual song?</p>

      <p>Art thou the same as when in manhood's pride</p>

      <p>I walked in joy thy grassy meads among,</p>

      <p>With that fair youthful vision by my side,</p>

      <p>In whose bright eyes I looked&mdash;and not in vain?</p>

      <p>O my adored angel! O my bride!</p>

      <p>Despite of years, and woe, and want, and pain,</p>

      <p>My soul yearns back towards thee, and I seem</p>

      <p>To wander with thee, hand in hand, again,</p>

      <p>By the bright margin of that flowing stream.</p>

      <p>I hear again thy voice, more silver-sweet</p>

      <p>Than fancied music floating in a dream,</p>

      <p>Possess my being; from afar I greet</p>

      <p>The waving of thy garments in the glade,</p>

      <p>And the light rustling of thy fairy feet&mdash;</p>

      <p>What time as one half eager, half afraid,</p>

      <p>Love's burning secret faltered on my tongue,</p>

      <p>And tremulous looks and broken words betrayed</p>

      <p>The secret of the heart from whence they sprung.</p>

      <p>Ah me! the earth that rendered thee to heaven</p>

      <p>Gave up an angel beautiful and young,</p>

      <p>Spotless and pure as snow when freshly driven:</p>

      <p>A bright Aurora for the starry sphere</p>

      <p>Where all is love, and even life forgiven.</p>

      <p>Bride of immortal beauty&mdash;ever dear!</p>

      <p>Dost thou await me in thy blest abode?</p>

      <p>While I, Tithonus-like, must linger here,</p>

      <p>And count each step along the rugged road;</p>

      <p>A phantom, tottering to a long-made grave,</p>

      <p>And eager to lay down my weary load!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I, who was fancy's lord, am fancy's slave.</p>

      <p>Like the low murmurs of the Indian shell</p>

      <p>Ta'en from its coral bed beneath the wave,</p>

      <p>Which, unforgetful of the ocean's swell,</p>

      <p>Retains within its mystic urn the hum</p>

      <p>Heard in the sea-grots where the Nereids dwell&mdash;</p>

      <p>Old thoughts still haunt me&mdash;unawares they come</p>

      <p>Between me and my rest, nor can I make</p>

      <p>Those aged visitors of sorrow dumb.</p>

      <p>Oh, yet awhile, my feeble soul, awake!</p>

      <p>Nor wander back with sullen steps again;</p>

      <p>For neither pleasant pastime canst thou take</p>

      <p>In such a journey, nor endure the pain.</p>

      <p>The phantoms of the past are dead for thee;</p>

      <p>So let them ever uninvoked remain,</p>

      <p>And be thou calm, till death shall set thee free.</p>

      <p>Thy flowers of hope expanded long ago,</p>

      <p>Long since their blossoms withered on the tree:</p>

      <p>No second spring can come to make them blow,</p>

      <p>But in the silent winter of the grave</p>

      <p>They lie with blighted love and buried woe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I did not waste the gifts which nature gave,</p>

      <p>Nor slothful lay in the Circ&eacute;an bower;</p>

      <p>Nor did I yield myself the willing slave</p>

      <p>Of lust for pride, for riches, or for power.</p>

      <p>No! in my heart a nobler spirit dwelt;</p>

      <p>For constant was my faith in manhood's dower;</p>

      <p>Man&mdash;made in God's own image&mdash;and I felt</p>

      <p>How of our own accord we courted shame,</p>

      <p>Until to idols like ourselves we knelt,</p>

      <p>And so renounced the great and glorious claim</p>

      <p>Of freedom, our immortal heritage.</p>

      <p>I saw how bigotry, with spiteful aim,</p>

      <p>Smote at the searching eyesight of the sage,</p>

      <p>How error stole behind the steps of truth,</p>

      <p>And cast delusion on the sacred page.</p>

      <p>So, as a champion, even in early youth</p>

      <p>I waged my battle with a purpose keen;</p>

      <p>Nor feared the hand of terror, nor the tooth</p>

      <p>Of serpent jealousy. And I have been</p>

      <p>With starry Galileo in his cell,</p>

      <p>That wise magician with the brow serene,</p>

      <p>Who fathomed space; and I have seen him tell</p>

      <p>The wonders of the planetary sphere,</p>

      <p>And trace the ramparts of heaven's citadel</p>

      <p>On the cold flag-stones of his dungeon drear.</p>

      <p>And I have walked with Hampden and with Vane&mdash;</p>

      <p>Names once so gracious to an English ear&mdash;</p>

      <p>In days that never may return again.</p>

      <p>My voice, though not the loudest, hath been heard</p>

      <p>Whenever freedom raised her cry of pain,</p>

      <p>And the faint effort of the humble bard</p>

      <p>Hath roused up thousands from their lethargy,</p>

      <p>To speak in words of thunder. What reward</p>

      <p>Was mine, or theirs? It matters not; for I</p>

      <p>Am but a leaf cast on the whirling tide,</p>

      <p>Without a hope or wish, except to die.</p>

      <p>But truth, asserted once, must still abide,</p>

      <p>Unquenchable, as are those fiery springs</p>

      <p>Which day and night gush from the mountain-side,</p>

      <p>Perpetual meteors girt with lambent wings,</p>

      <p>Which the wild tempest tosses to and fro,</p>

      <p>But cannot conquer with the force it brings.</p>

      <p>Yet I, who ever felt another's woe</p>

      <p>More keenly than my own untold distress;</p>

      <p>I, who have battled with the common foe,</p>

      <p>And broke for years the bread of bitterness;</p>

      <p>Who never yet abandoned or betrayed</p>

      <p>The trust vouchsafed me, nor have ceased to bless,</p>

      <p>Am left alone to wither in the shade,</p>

      <p>A weak old man, deserted by his kind&mdash;</p>

      <p>Whom none will comfort in his age, nor aid!</p>

  <h2>HERMOTIMUS</h2>

  <p>Hermotimus, the hero of this ballad, was a philosopher, or
  rather a prophet, of Clazomen&aelig;, who possessed the faculty,
  now claimed by the animal-magnetists, of effecting a voluntary
  separation between his soul and body; for the former could wander
  to any part of the universe, and even hold intercourse with
  supernatural beings, whilst the senseless frame remained at home.
  Hermotimus, however, was not insensible to the risk attendant
  upon this disunion; since, before attempting any of these aerial
  flights, he took the precaution to warn his wife, lest, ere the
  return of his soul, the body should be rendered an unfit or
  useless receptacle. This accident, which he so much dreaded, at
  length occurred; for the lady, wearied out by a succession of
  trances, each of longer duration than the preceding, one day
  committed his body to the flames, and thus effectually put a stop
  to such unconnubial conduct. He received divine honours at
  Clazomen&aelig;, but must nevertheless remain as a terrible
  example and warning to all husbands who carry their scientific or
  spiritual pursuits so far as to neglect their duty to their
  wives.</p>

  <p>It is somewhat curious that Hermotimus is not the only person
  (putting the disciples of Mesmer and Dupotet altogether out of
  the question) who has possessed this miraculous power. Another
  and much later instance is recorded by Dr. George Cheyne, in his
  work entitled, <i>The English Malady, or a Treatise of Nervous
  Diseases</i>, as having come under his own observation; and, as
  this case is exactly similar to that of the Prophet, it may amuse
  the reader to see how far an ancient fable may be illustrated,
  and in part explained, by the records of modern science. Dr.
  Cheyne's patient was probably cataleptic; but the worthy
  physician must be allowed to tell his own story.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Townshend, a gentleman of honour and integrity, had
  for many years been afflicted with a nephritic complaint. His
  illness increasing, and his strength decaying, he came from
  Bristol to Bath in a litter, in autumn, and lay at the Bell Inn.
  Dr. Baynard and I were called to him, and attended him twice
  a-day; but his vomitings continuing still incessant and obstinate
  against all remedies, we despaired of his recovery. While he was
  in this condition, he sent for us one morning; we waited on him
  with Mr. Skrine, his apothecary. We found his senses clear, and
  his mind calm: his nurse and several servants were about him. He
  told us he had sent for us to give him an account of an odd
  sensation he had for some time observed and felt in himself;
  which was, that, by composing himself, <i>he could die or expire
  when he pleased</i>; and yet by an effort, or somehow, he could
  come to life again, which he had sometimes tried before he had
  sent for us. We heard this with surprise; but, as it was not to
  be accounted for upon common principles, we could hardly believe
  the fact as he related it, much less give any account of it;
  unless he should please to make the experiment before us, which
  we were unwilling he should do, lest, in his weak condition, he
  might carry it too far. He continued to talk very distinctly and
  sensibly above a quarter of an hour about this surprising
  sensation, and insisted so much on our seeing the trial made,
  that we were at last forced to comply. We all three felt his
  pulse first&mdash;it was distinct, though small and thready, and
  his heart had its usual beating. He composed himself on his back,
  and lay in a still posture for some time: while I held his right
  hand, Dr. Baynard laid his hand on his heart, and Mr. Skrine held
  a clean looking-glass to his mouth. I found his pulse sink
  gradually, till at last I could not find any by the most exact
  and nice touch. Dr. Baynard could not feel the least motion in
  his heart, nor Mr. Skrine the least soil of breath on the bright
  mirror he held to his mouth; then each of us by turns examined
  his arm, heart, and breath, but could not, by the nicest
  scrutiny, discover the least symptom of life in him. We reasoned
  a long time about this odd appearance as well as we could, and
  all of us judging it inexplicable and unaccountable; and, finding
  he still continued in that condition, we began to conclude that
  he had indeed carried the experiment too far; and at last were
  satisfied he was actually dead, and were just ready to leave him.
  This continued about half an hour. As we were going away, we
  observed some motion about the body; and, upon examination, found
  his pulse and the motion of his heart gradually returning. He
  began to breathe gently and speak softly. We were all astonished
  to the last degree at this unexpected change; and, after some
  further conversation with him, and among ourselves, went away
  fully satisfied as to all the particulars of this fact, but
  confounded and puzzled, and not able to form any rational scheme
  that might account for it."</p>

      <p class="i2">As the weary day went down.</p>

      <p>So I lay and sorely pondered</p>

      <p class="i2">On the days long since gone by,</p>

      <p>When my old prim&aelig;val forests</p>

      <p class="i2">Echoed to the war-man's cry;</p>

      <p>When the race of Thor and Odin</p>

      <p class="i2">Held their battles by my side,</p>

      <p>And the blood of man was mingling</p>

      <p class="i2">Warmly with my chilly tide.</p>

      <p>Father Euxine! thou rememb'rest</p>

      <p class="i2">How I brought thee tribute then&mdash;</p>

      <p>Swollen corpses, gashed and gory,</p>

      <p class="i2">Heads and limbs of slaughter'd men?</p>

      <p>Father Euxine! be thou joyful!</p>

      <p class="i2">I am running red once more&mdash;</p>

      <p>Not with heathen blood, as early,</p>

      <p class="i2">But with gallant Christian gore!</p>

      <p>For the old times are returning,</p>

      <p class="i2">And the Cross is broken down,</p>

      <p>And I hear the tocsin sounding</p>

      <p class="i2">In the village and the town;</p>

      <p>And the glare of burning cities</p>

      <p class="i2">Soon shall light me on my way&mdash;</p>

      <p>Ha! my heart is big and jocund</p>

      <p class="i2">With the draught I drank to-day.</p>

      <p>Ha! I feel my strength awakened,</p>

      <p class="i2">And my brethren shout to me;</p>

      <p>Each is leaping red and joyous</p>

      <p class="i2">To his own awaiting sea.</p>

      <p>Rhine and Elbe are plunging downward</p>

      <p class="i2">Through their wild anarchic land,</p>

      <p>Everywhere are Christians falling</p>

      <p class="i2">By their brother Christians' hand!</p>

      <p>Yea, the old times are returning,</p>

      <p class="i2">And the olden gods are here!</p>

      <p>Take my tribute, Father Euxine,</p>

      <p class="i2">To thy waters dark and drear.</p>

      <p>Therefore come I with my torrents,</p>

      <p class="i2">Shaking castle, crag, and town;</p>

      <p>Therefore, with the shout of thunder,</p>

      <p class="i2">Sweep I herd and herdsman down;</p>

      <p>Therefore leap I to thy bosom,</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
